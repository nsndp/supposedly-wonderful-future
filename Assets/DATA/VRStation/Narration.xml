	<Line ID="1" Text="As the ride drags on, you think of hidden underground facilities and secret research labs; of oblivious Hong Kong tourists and chats with Lovecraftian monsters that happen right beneath their feet;[pause] of elevators that are not just elevators but cleverly disguised means of transportation that take you through an elaborate system of tunnels to an undisclosed location where bleary-eyed employees are toiling away, driven mad by revelations and forever silenced by NDAs." />
