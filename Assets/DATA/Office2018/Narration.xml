    <Line ID="0" Text="Wednesday, July 18th, 2018.[pause] Not your favorite way to start a story… the exact date is rarely that important.[pause] It’s just a convention, you know? An arbitrary system made up by humans to count the Earth’s rotations.[pause] Still, they say you have to understand your place in time and space. Then again, they say a lot of pretentious things, and usually you can’t even tell for sure who the heck “they” are supposed to be." />
    <Line ID="1" Text="Regardless, the day is young, so you decide to go with the flow and proceed into the office.[pause] The sun is shining shamelessly through the window, no doubt on its evil quest to sneak UV radiation past the ozone layer again.[pause] You take a look around, slowly acknowledging the environment that didn’t even exist 6 months ago but already feels comfortably familiar.[pause] Your own business. No bosses, no rules, no bureaucracy – only projects to use your skills on, and real clients to make happy." />
    <Line ID="2" Text="It’s a tiny company, of course; just 2 programmer friends who decided to go official. Nothing special – thousands of people try to do the same thing all around the world.[pause] Still, even more people would call it crazy. Too risky, they’d say. No guarantee of success, no clear way to rise above the competition, and dozens of ways to go bankrupt.[pause] They would prefer the illusion of secure employment, with crippling bureaucracy, pointless rules, and no sense of meaningful impact whatsoever, even if they hate it all as much as the next guy." />
    <Line ID="3" Text="And you are a long way from proving those folks wrong, but you haven’t proven them right either.[pause] The clients are coming, the clients are satisfied – enough to keep you busy, and enough to keep you happy with your bank account. The clients have grand plans, and they trust you will turn them into reality." />
	<Line ID="4" Text="Perhaps this is how good life decisions should look like: daring enough to feel crazy, yet logical enough to be real.[pause] They say you need to step out of your comfort zone. But you don’t have to do it every day.[pause] That’s the thing about zones: whenever you leave one, you very quickly find yourself inside another. Today, you can embrace the routine and keep making this new zone more comfy." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="As you look around, you notice the familiar blinking of the phone on your desk.[pause] It seems like Samuel, your fearless partner in crime, has left you a message. You should probably check it out if you’re done admiring the surroundings." />
