	<Line ID="1" Text="“Mister Martin? Not sure I like how it sounds. But whatever, it’s just a name.”" />
	<Line ID="2" Text="“It’s not a name, it’s the name. Your real one.”" />
	<Line ID="3" Text="“Umm…”" />
	<Line ID="4" Text="“Are you aware of your addiction to virtual reality, mister Martin?”" />
	<Line ID="5" Text="““Addiction” is such a dirty word… we’re all addicted to something.”" />
	<Line ID="6" Text="“Oh, I didn’t mean it to sound negative. It’s just that your situation is pretty unique. It seems that you’ve been using it so intently, you’ve managed to fool your own brain.[pause] You don’t just relate to the characters of fictional stories – you ARE the characters. You think that their lives are your real lives, all at once. You treat your favorite scenes from games and movies as if they were your fondest personal memories.”" />
	<Line ID="7" Text="“So?”" />
	<Line ID="8" Text="“We believe this is a serious life-threatening condition. You are a former employee of LIFE+, so it is our responsibility to…”" />
	<Line ID="9" Text="“LIFE+? Wait, is this the real world? I thought I managed to drop it for good. How come I am aware of this conversation?”" />
	<Line ID="10" Text="“We gave you a medication. It’s proved to temporarily bring you back to your senses.”" />
	<Line ID="11" Text="“I… why are you inside my apartment? I never invite anyone to my apartment. How did you guys even appear on my doorstep again? I left you like a year ago! Or was it a month? I can’t remember…”" />
	<Line ID="12" Text="“We let ourselves in. You know we monitor the well-being of our former colleagues. We were worried, and rightfully so.”" />
	<Line ID="13" Text="“I didn’t ask for your help.”" />
	<Line ID="14" Text="“Mister Martin, you are spending 22 hours a day with your VR headgear on. For the rest of the time, you are wandering around like a zombie: eating food, drinking water, relieving yourself, all with being barely aware of your surroundings.”" />
	<Line ID="15" Text="“So? Don’t you think it’s great that my brain figured out how to do what I want and still sustain my body?”" />
	<Line ID="16" Text="“Actually, no, your brain is clearly suffering. According to our scans, you developed a mental illness akin to schizophrenia, and there’s an indication of further physical deterioration.[pause] If you keep going like this, there’s a high chance you will fall into a coma and eventually die.”" />
	<Line ID="17" Text="“Well, then just leave your wonderful meds at my place and be on your way.”" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="“It’s not that simple. The effect is diminishing with each dose; your body is developing a resistance. We have to try… behavior therapy, for the lack of a better word.[pause] With your help, we can design a special VR experience with your most important ‘memories’ in it. Then, you will share it with our specialist, who will try to guide you from the inside towards realizing that none of them are real.[pause] If your mind can see all the confusion by its own volition, perhaps it will reestablish the line between life and fiction.”" />
	<Line ID="19" Text="“I refuse.”" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="“Mister Martin, please…”" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="“Please what? You don’t get to decide how I live my life! It’s my choice, you hear me?”" />
	<Line ID="22" Text="“Your choice is unreasonable. You can’t enjoy your fantasies if you’re dead.”" />
	<Line ID="23" Text="“I can’t enjoy them if I leave VR either. I will not return to the real world. I’d rather go out with a bang. Whatever the time I have left, I’ll take it.”" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="“What if we can extend this time? What if we’ll be able to remove the negative effects without forcing you to abandon your addiction?”" />
	<Line ID="25" Text="“I didn’t realize this was an option.”" />
	<Line ID="26" Text="“But it is. Like I said, your case is unique, so we don’t know what will happen until we try it. It is possible that the therapy will make you more mentally resilient. Then you’ll be able to use VR without suffering such damage.”" />
	<Line ID="27" Text="“You… you mean it? There is a chance?”" />
	<Line ID="28" Text="“Yes.”" />
	<Line ID="29" Text="“…fine. Let’s do it. But if it doesn’t work, I want you to leave me alone.”" />
	<Line ID="30" Text="“You have our word.”" />
	
	<Line ID="35" Text="“You lied to him.”" />
	<Line ID="36" Text="“I didn’t. I simply confirmed there’s a chance.”" />
	<Line ID="37" Text="“Yeah, right. There’s also a chance that aliens are hiding among us.”" />
	<Line ID="38" Text="“Well, there is. Whether it’s high or low is a whole different matter.”" />
	<Line ID="39" Text="“Is that your excuse? What are we, salesmen? You saw the calculations, and it’s pretty damn clear. His brain can take another 3-4 months of this, tops.[pause] And at a certain point, it’ll be too late to turn back. The guy either returns to real life soon or turns into a vegetable.”" />
	<Line ID="40" Text="“Look, what do you want from me? It’s not my fault the higher-ups are pushing for this experiment. We are instructed to convince him, even if it means bending the truth.[pause] But we are also instructed to include the full truth into his VR set. He will know it before making the final decision.[pause] Hell, I’ll even go ahead and include this very conversation. Can’t let your crowning moment of righteousness go to waste…”" />
