	<Line ID="2" Text="Okay, Jackie. Is this another one of your no-briefing, come-and-punch-you-in-the-face problems?" />
	<Line ID="3" Text="The element of surprise is lost, you know. It’s clear that I’ll have to wander around the area until I accidentally do whatever it is you want me to do, after which you will appear and start talking, and talking, and talking, and talking until I’m completely convinced that you had my best interests at heart – or until my ears fall off, whichever is sooner." />

	<Line ID="12" Text="Oh, good. A fellow lost soul." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="Who indeed… I don’t seem to remember. What about you?" />
	<Line ID="14" Text="Eh… what, sorry?" />
	<Line ID="15" Text="Who are you?" />
	<Line ID="16" Text="I said “a fellow lost soul.” Or are you not lost?" />
	<Line ID="17" Text="Oh, no, I feel very much lost. In fact, I don’t even remember who I am. What about you, mister?" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="Name’s Michael. Pleased to meet you." />
	<Line ID="19" Text="You mean, do I remember who I am? Yes, thankfully." />
	<Line ID="20" Text="Oh, never mind me. Chances are you’re going to hate me by the end of the day." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="Likewise. Eh, I’m sorry, but… where are you?[pause] I hear your voice, but there’s nobody around. All I see is some table with photo frames on it." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Then I guess you have me at a disadvantage here… eh… where are you, by the way?[pause] I hear your voice, but there’s nobody around. All I see is some table with photo frames on it." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="Hate you? No, I’m not the kind to… eh… where are you, by the way?[pause] I hear your voice, but there’s nobody around. All I see is some table with photo frames on it." />
	<Line ID="24" Text="That’s what I see as well." />
	<Line ID="25" Text="You mean we can’t see each other? Great, the voice in my head is really getting out of control." />
	<Line ID="26" Text="So we’re looking at the same thing? Well, that’s reassuring." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="Don’t worry, I’m pretty sure I’m a separate person… only I can’t recall anything about him." />
	<Line ID="28" Text="Where are we, exactly?" />
	<Line ID="29" Text="No idea. It’s kinda hazy. What do you think?" />
	<Line ID="30" Text="Well, I have a number of explanations… all them are equally improbable." />
	<Line ID="31" Text="I’m pretty tired of thinking, to be honest." />
	<Line ID="32" Text="Yeah… hey, do you mind if I keep quiet for a bit? It just feels like I’m forgetting something, something very important… something besides my identity, I mean…" />

	<Line ID="35" Text="" />
	<Line ID="36" Text="There is a name here: Harvey Martin. Is it yours?" />
	<Line ID="37" Text="Harvey Martin? Not sure I like how it sounds. But whatever, it’s just a name. You can call me as such if you want." />
	
	<Line ID="40" Text="" />
	<Line ID="41" Text="Hey, look, the images are moving. Sort of." />
	<Line ID="42" Text="They must be digital photo frames, or some similar devices." />
	<Line ID="43" Text="…what? Oh, that’s nice. Are these yours?" />
	<Line ID="44" Text="Mine? Why would they be mine?" />
	<Line ID="45" Text="No. I thought they might be yours, actually." />
	<Line ID="46" Text="Well, they’re not mine, and there are only two of us here, so…" />
	<Line ID="47" Text="But I’m not the one with the memory problems, remember?" />
	<Line ID="48" Text="No, they’re not mine either. I don’t remember them." />
	<Line ID="49" Text="But you can’t remember much of anything, right? Not even your name." />
	<Line ID="50" Text="But you can’t remember much of anything, right? A moment ago, we didn’t even know your name." />
	<Line ID="51" Text="That’s true. Still, none of these views ring any bells." />
	<Line ID="52" Text="Are you sure? A closer look won’t hurt." />
	<Line ID="53" Text="I guess you’re right. Just give me a moment, okay?" />
	
	<Line ID="60" Text="So, eh… it’s a street." />
	<Line ID="61" Text="So, eh… it’s a woman." />
	<Line ID="62" Text="So, eh… it’s an alleyway." />
	<Line ID="63" Text="Thanks, captain." />
	<Line ID="64" Text="I see that, but not much else." />

	<Line ID="69" Text="Really? It’s so photoshopped, I can barely tell." />
	<Line ID="70" Text="Hey, I’m just following your own suggestion. Maybe saying it aloud will bring my memories closer to the surface.[pause] I mean, it’s kinda starting to feel familiar, but… ugh, I probably just need a bit more time." />
	<Line ID="71" Text="Well, yeah, there isn’t much to look at. The buildings are standing, the cars are moving… there’s also a person crossing the street in the back, but it’s a bit hard to discern.[pause] It’s starting to feel familiar, but… ugh, I probably just need a bit more time." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="Well, yeah, there isn’t much to look at. The woman runs forward, then stops to watch the view. Grabs the railings, looks excited…[pause] it’s starting to feel familiar, but… ugh, I probably just need a bit more time." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="Well, yeah, there isn’t much to look at. Children running, laundry drying on the lines, a woman doing some kind of chore. And then it changes to another view with a lot of roofs.[pause] It’s starting to feel familiar, but… ugh, I probably just need a bit more time." />
	<Line ID="74" Text="There’s a street going from left to right, see? Cars are moving. There’s also a person crossing the street in the back, but it’s a bit hard to discern." />
	<Line ID="75" Text="There’s a girl on the right, see? She’s running somewhere, then stopping, probably to watch the view. She looks… excited?" />
	<Line ID="76" Text="There are people moving around, see? The kid to the left is running, while the woman in the center is doing some kind of chore. There is also laundry drying on the lines. Then it changes to another view with a lot of roofs." />
	<Line ID="77" Text="Oh, yeah, I get it now." />
	<Line ID="78" Text="I’ll take your word for it." />
	<Line ID="79" Text="It’s starting to feel familiar, but… ugh, I probably just need a bit more time." />
	<Line ID="80" Text="That’s fine. Take as long as necessary." />
	<Line ID="81" Text="Time, we seem to have. For now." />
	
	<Line ID="83" Text="" />
	<Line ID="84" Text="How about this one?" />
	<Line ID="85" Text="No, nothing yet. It feels so close, but I can’t grasp it, sorry." />
	<Line ID="86" Text="" />
	<Line ID="87" Text="How about this one?" />
	<Line ID="88" Text="No, nothing yet. It feels so close, but I can’t grasp it, sorry." />
	
	<Line ID="90" Text="" />
	<Line ID="91" Text="Hey, look. Two more frames have activated." />
	<Line ID="92" Text="It’s as if they are programmed to react to our conversation." />
	<Line ID="93" Text="(Say nothing)" />
	<Line ID="94" Text="Yeah, I noticed. They seem familiar as well." />
	<Line ID="95" Text="I think I might be the one who programmed them, yes. I don’t know why, though. Did I want certain things to activate only after I say certain words?" />
	
	<Line ID="100" Text="Wait… I think I remember this street. It’s the one I see every morning on my way to work… or used to see, anyway." />
	<Line ID="101" Text="So these are your photos after all." />
	<Line ID="102" Text="I think so, yes. I take this road when I go to the office. Walking, I mean.[pause] I live close by; it only takes 17 minutes to get there from my apartment. It’s convenient to live near your work." />
	<Line ID="103" Text="Go on." />
	<Line ID="104" Text="It may not look much, but it’s a pretty crowded place, this street; a lot of people are using it.[pause] Occasionally I look at their faces. Some faces, I recognize. They walk down the street all the time, just like me.[pause] A bald guy uses the same zebra crossing every morning; we look each other in the eyes, put on a smile, and nod.[pause] We never talk, though. There is nothing to talk about.[clear]Sometimes I look around. There’s a pleasant smell coming from a nearby bakery, but I’ve never been there; I’m never hungry when I see it.[pause] There is a bike in front of the entrance – it always stands there, without fail.[pause] There is a farmer’s market to the right, but it’s open only on Fridays. I don’t have time to visit it." />
	<Line ID="105" Text="Keep it coming." />
	<Line ID="106" Text="You remembered all this just by looking at one frame?" />
	<Line ID="107" Text="Wait, why are you telling me this all of a sudden?" />
	<Line ID="108" Text="Yes, surprisingly enough. I guess these images are really important to me in some way." />
	<Line ID="109" Text="Well, keep it coming." />
	<Line ID="110" Text="Eh… I mean, why not? It feels important to me… and maybe it can be important to you, in some way." />
	<Line ID="111" Text="Go on, then." />
	<Line ID="112" Text="Once in a while, I look at the sky. It goes through a nice variety of colors, but I’ve already seen them all.[pause] If there are clouds, I try to find funny shapes. One day, I was watching a cloud and bumped into an old lady, but she just smiled.[pause] People are polite here; they never scold you for not paying attention.[clear]Mostly, though, I just look at my feet. At the shoes and shadows, at the fallen leaves, at the patterns in the pavement.[pause] I try not to step on the cracks or seams. I feel uncomfortable when I do that.[clear]When I get to the office, I chat with my colleagues. Some of them live pretty far away; they need to drive for a full hour.[pause] They tell me how their car kept slowing down for no reason. They tell me about a traffic jam at the corner of such-and-such. I’m very lucky to live so close to work." />
	<Line ID="113" Text="You don’t sound lucky." />
	<Line ID="114" Text="If you say so." />
	<Line ID="115" Text="1440 minutes." />
	<Line ID="116" Text="What?" />
	<Line ID="117" Text="1440 minutes in a day. 420 minutes to sleep. 5 minutes to get up. 6 minutes to brush teeth. 15 minutes to take a shower.[pause] 30 minutes to have breakfast. 10 minutes to get dressed. 17 minutes to walk down the street. 5 minutes to check in at the office.[pause] 300 minutes to work. 40 minutes to have lunch. 300 minutes to work again. 5 minutes to check out." />
	<Line ID="118" Text="You are one precise dude." />
	<Line ID="119" Text="Is this going somewhere?" />
	<Line ID="120" Text="It’s numbers. Algorithm. Quantifying.[pause] They help to occupy the mind, but they don’t add meaning. No, meaning is found elsewhere.[pause] 17 minutes to walk back. 30 minutes to shop. 60 minutes for dinner. 60 minutes to sit lost in thought.[pause] 120 minutes to use VR. Yes, those are nice 120 minutes. The rest of them, not so much." />
	<Line ID="121" Text="I suppose I can relate to that." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="A little variety can be good for you, you know." />
	<Line ID="123" Text="Do you at least spend time with your family on weekends or something?" />
	<Line ID="124" Text="Thanks. Do you want to look at the other frames? I think it’s starting to come back to me. The rest of the memories should be much better." />
	<Line ID="125" Text="Yeah, I guess so. Do you want to look at the other frames? I think it’s starting to come back to me. The rest of the memories should be much better." />
	<Line ID="126" Text="Yeah, I guess I do. Do you want to look at the other frames? I think it’s starting to come back to me. The rest of the memories should be much better." />
	
	<Line ID="130" Text="Yes, of course, I know who she is now… that was pretty embarrassing, not to recognize your own wife." />
	<Line ID="131" Text="Tell me about her." />
	<Line ID="132" Text="Oh dear, is there a love story coming up?" />
	<Line ID="133" Text="We were both students at the time. I met her in a lecture hall – surface integrals, an introductory calculus course…[pause] man, she was jotting down those notes like nobody’s business. I asked to explain a few formulas, so she did. She always understood things better than me – in class and in life alike." />
	<Line ID="134" Text="Yeah, I probably won’t say anything you haven’t heard before… but it’s my love story, I’m certain of that now, so it’s dear to me. I hope you understand.[clear]We were both students at the time. I met her in a lecture hall – surface integrals, an introductory calculus course…[pause] man, she was jotting down those notes like nobody’s business. I asked to explain a few formulas, so she did.

	<Line ID="135" Text="So she’s smart." />
	<Line ID="136" Text="Was?" />
	<Line ID="137" Text="Go on." />
	<Line ID="138" Text="Oh, she was so much more than just smart. Kind, compassionate, confident, honest, funny, witty, wise…[pause] she cherished life like I thought wasn’t even possible. She was my favorite person in the whole wide world." />
	<Line ID="139" Text="Still is. At least I think so… I can’t put any of this into a wider context yet, sorry." />
	<Line ID="140" Text="We talked for a bit after that, and the next time, and the time after that as well. I was so transfixed, I even forgot to be shy, and asked her out almost immediately. She said yes![pause] Apparently, I was the first guy at the university to approach her. Guess she was a bit intimidating, always furiously writing down everything teachers said, he-he.[pause] We started dating. Six months later, I proposed. Two months after, we were married." />
	<Line ID="141" Text="Pretty snappy." />
	<Line ID="142" Text="Did you even bother to keep studying?" />
	<Line ID="143" Text="There was a wonderful certainty about it all. A nagging feeling that stuff might fall apart at any moment – the one I’d lived with for years – was gone now.[pause] I was so certain the events were unfolding as they were supposed to, it felt almost spiritual. Must be a side effect of that thing they call Love.[pause] We still waited a bit with our honeymoon, though… didn’t go until after graduation." />
	<Line ID="144" Text="Sure. If nothing else, we got better at it, probably because we were always helping each other. High energy physics stood no chance against our teamwork.[pause] We waited until after graduation with our honeymoon, though." />
	<Line ID="145" Text="And this frame depicts a part of that honeymoon, I take it?" />
	<Line ID="146" Text="Yep, one of the many beautiful views we saw during it. She was always the best part of any view, as you can imagine.[pause] Man, we had the craziest honeymoon our money could buy… traveled all around the world. It was our act of rebellion against looming adult responsibilities.[pause] I mean, we could get a house with this sum – well, not an entire house, but pay a deposit and have enough left for furniture and home improvements.[pause] But a house is just stuff. Stuff breaks and falls apart, even before you do. Memories, however? Good memories are for life.[clear]We roamed around Europe, Asia, and both Americas.[pause] We put love locks on as many bridges as we could find, took every ride in every amusement park we could get in.[pause] We looked down at the world from Burj Khalifa, Eiffel Tower, and St. Peter’s Dome.[pause] We saw northern lights and floating lanterns, went diving and skydiving.[pause] We fooled around in a swimming pool that was 55 floors above the ground.[pause] We shouted the names of our favorite ice cream flavors from the mountaintops.[pause] It was glorious, silly, and absolutely unforgettable." />
	<Line ID="147" Text="I think I’m getting jealous." />
	<Line ID="148" Text="That must have taken a long time." />
	<Line ID="149" Text="I’m an extremely lucky guy, aren’t I? In fact, I felt so lucky I couldn’t believe my own happiness, and kept nagging her with questions throughout the trip. She always had the best answers, of course.[pause] I’d say, “You are my teacher. Why did you decide to teach me everything about life?” and she’d say, “A teacher always learns as much as her students.”[pause] I’d say, “You are my perfection. There is no way I look as perfect to you as you look to me,” and she’d say, “You have no idea.”[clear]And here, as we leaned on the balcony’s railing, I said another thing. “You are my angel. What did I actually do to deserve you?”[pause] It didn’t even sound like a question this time, really, more like a thought said out loud; an idle musing on God’s mysterious ways. But she responded anyway." />
	<Line ID="150" Text="Yeah, you’re probably right. But we felt so blessed, the passage of time just didn’t matter anymore.[pause] In fact, I could barely believe my own happiness, and kept nagging her with questions throughout the trip.

	<Line ID="160" Text="My, how could I forget this little neighborhood? My entire childhood happened here. It was my home." />
	<Line ID="161" Text="Seems like a nice enough place." />
	<Line ID="162" Text="Must’ve been one of the cheaper districts." />
	<Line ID="163" Text="What, these decrepit shacks?" />
	<Line ID="164" Text="Nope, still nothing. How can you recognize anything from these outlines is a mystery to me." />
	<Line ID="165" Text="You think so? I guess it does look surprisingly decent in this state, with the black-and-white filter hiding all the dirt. Then again, it can’t hide anything from me… not when the full version is already ingrained in my mind.[pause] I was a slum kid; the kind who doesn’t always get enough food and water, let alone computers or toys. Born into absolute poverty – and faced with a good chance to remain in it for life." />
	<Line ID="166" Text="Yeah, that’s a polite way to put it. I was a slum kid… the kind who doesn’t always get enough food and water, let alone computers or toys.[pause] Born into absolute poverty – and faced with a good chance to remain in it for life." />
	<Line ID="167" Text="It does look pretty shabby, doesn’t it? You can see it even through all these image filters.[pause] Then again, it’s not surprising.

	<Line ID="168" Text="Well, when the images are already ingrained in your mind, all you need is a little trigger.[pause] Then again, there isn’t anything grand here to see.

	<Line ID="171" Text="Well, looks like you turned out all right in the end." />
	<Line ID="172" Text="Don’t be. Even if it wasn’t pleasant, it’s still part of my life. Besides, I didn’t remain, or we wouldn’t be having this conversation, right?" />
	<Line ID="173" Text="Statistically speaking, it’s nothing out of the ordinary. There was a time when almost 20% of the world’s population lived in such conditions. That’s roughly one in a five chance to spend your infancy in the slums.[pause] Sadly, the chance to spend the rest of your life elsewhere was somewhat lower." />
	<Line ID="174" Text="Yeah… in the end." />
	<Line ID="175" Text="Was it as bad as they say?" />
	<Line ID="176" Text="What was it like?" />
	<Line ID="177" Text="But I assume you’re going to tell me all about it." />
	<Line ID="178" Text="Depends on what you mean by “they.” Was it a place of endless despair and misery, a ghetto for the poor where all hope is lost and nothing left to do except slowly fade away while cursing the unjust world?[pause] No. But it was damn hard nonetheless.[clear]The conditions were horrible, that’s for sure. Contaminated water, open drains, lack of basic sanitation and utilities… perfect breeding ground for life-threatening diseases.[pause] Little kids were in the biggest danger. Human body needs a lot of care before it can properly face Mother Nature’s challenges… some never made it to that point." />
	<Line ID="179" Text="It was… a lot of different things. Hard, yes, but not as miserable and hopeless as some outsiders made it out to be.[pause] Bear in mind, though, that my memories are now influenced by time and distance.

As we grew older, the chances of survival increased, yet the challenges were only starting.[pause] The exhausting thing about poverty is the sheer amount of planning and thinking you need even for the most trivial activities. Bathing, washing, cooking all felt like hard, stressful work – and not everyone is prepared to do hard work.[clear]Crime was frequent; suicides, not unusual.

	<Line ID="549" Text="It’s better than to trust your wishful thinking." />
	<Line ID="550" Text="They could’ve made everything up, for all I know. There is no problem here, don’t you understand?" />
	<Line ID="551" Text="How can there be no problem? Can’t you recognize your own symptoms? Just remember how lost and confused you were before." />
	<Line ID="552" Text="I think you know that’s not the case. You just refuse to acknowledge it." />
	<Line ID="553" Text="Are you sure? Because you seem to be in denial." />
	<Line ID="554" Text="I feel much better now. I’ll be alright." />
	<Line ID="555" Text="Look… even if it’s true, what other choice do I have?" />
	<Line ID="556" Text="To search for balance, of course. You can probably have your 120 minutes back… just give real life another chance." />
	<Line ID="557" Text="None. You either enjoy your last couple of months or drop VR for good. You never wanted to compromise anyway." />
	<Line ID="558" Text="If you believe LIFE+, you know that’s not true. I may have an exit now, but if I return here – even months down the road – my brain will relapse, and there will be no leaving, emotionally or physically.[pause] And between the two alternatives… I thought it over, and I made my decision. Please accept it. Please let me be." />

	<Line ID="560" Text="Exactly. There will be no golden ending here. And between the two alternatives… I thought it over, and I made my decision. Please accept it. Please let me be." />
	
	<Line ID="565" Text="Have you considered my points? Will you leave now?" />
	<Line ID="566" Text="No. Sorry, but I won’t." />
	<Line ID="567" Text="Yes. I don’t think I have the right to convince you anymore." />
	<Line ID="568" Text="I will think some more." />
	<Line ID="569" Text="Yes… please do." />
	<Line ID="570" Text="…really?" />
	<Line ID="571" Text="Really. LIFE+ trust me completely. They’re okay with anything I decide as long as I believe in it. So I’m going to exercise this right. I will let you stay." />
	<Line ID="572" Text="I mean, they probably want me to drag you back into real life using my incredible persuasion powers or whatever… but I won’t do it. There’s been enough meddling already." />
	<Line ID="573" Text="I didn’t really dare to hope for it… I thought you will force me back into real life. Guess my hate for LIFE+ was misplaced after all." />
	<Line ID="574" Text="They’re not bad people. They may appear overbearing, but they’re trying to listen as well as they can." />
	<Line ID="575" Text="Don’t worry about LIFE+. I don’t think they will bother you anymore." />
	<Line ID="576" Text="Nothing to do with LIFE+. But I make my own choices, and I respect people who do the same." />
	<Line ID="577" Text="Thank you… I don’t have much time left, as you understand… but I will cherish it, I promise." />
	<Line ID="578" Text="Time is not everything. None of us know the exact remaining time anyway. Just live your life the way you want." />
	<Line ID="579" Text="Yeah, you do that." />

	<Line ID="581" Text="Farewell, my friend. Have a blast." />
	<Line ID="582" Text="Goodbye." />
	
	<Line ID="585" Text="Do you not respect my choice?" />
	<Line ID="586" Text="I do. But I respect your life even more. And I won’t let you kill yourself." />
	<Line ID="587" Text="No, and I don’t respect you." />
	<Line ID="588" Text="What?" />
	<Line ID="589" Text="I don’t think anyone respects you. You think your real life is meaningless? Well, I’m sure you are 100% right." />
	<Line ID="590" Text="…what kind of convincing is that?" />
	<Line ID="591" Text="You see, stuff like respect and meaning have to be earned. It’s not lying on the street, even if you walk on it every day for 17 minutes. You have to work hard, figure stuff out, solve your problems. But you can’t solve problems, can you? All you do is run away." />
	<Line ID="592" Text="I solve the problems that I want, and I walk away from the rest. I make my own choices." />
	<Line ID="593" Text="No, you don’t. Your fear is the one making the choices. You are nothing but a coward." />
	<Line ID="594" Text="Do you think being rude will help to prove your case?" />
	<Line ID="595" Text="I’m just giving you a wake-up call. Get your shit together, man. Toughen up before your brain turns into jelly for good." />
	<Line ID="596" Text="You should be grateful we even bother with this conversation, boy. Others would have yanked that stupid thing off your head and committed you to a mental institution." />
	<Line ID="597" Text="Yeah… LIFE+ must have lost it completely." />
	<Line ID="598" Text="Forget about LIFE+. You’re talking to me now." />
	<Line ID="599" Text="No, the best one at loosing here is you." />
	<Line ID="600" Text="You’re just proving my point. I mean, this is not my main reason to stay away from reality, but it’s definitely in the top ten.[pause] This ignorance… you’re not even listening to me, are you? You don’t bother to understand, just judge.[pause] Go on then, do your worst. Unplug me, drug me, lobotomize me. Just don’t expect me to waste any more words." />
	<Line ID="601" Text="You’re pathetic… but that is not surprising. At least I can leave now." />
	<Line ID="602" Text="Yes, I will offer LIFE+ to do exactly that. Goodbye." />
	
	<Line ID="605" Text="I’m not killing myself… I’m refusing to sacrifice everything in order to save myself. It’s just a side effect of my choice." />
	<Line ID="606" Text="Then there’s no choice to be made at all – only a realization to have." />
	<Line ID="607" Text="What realization?" />
	<Line ID="608" Text="That you have a responsibility to live." />
	<Line ID="609" Text="Responsibility to whom?" />
	<Line ID="610" Text="To your real family and relatives. To your friends, colleagues, neighbors. To passersby and strangers. To the bald guy who uses the same zebra crossing every morning. To everyone you have or will affect. To the world." />
	<Line ID="611" Text="That’s nonsense. Nobody needs me." />
	<Line ID="612" Text="That’s not nonsense, that’s life. It’s not easy, and it’s not clear, but it’s meaningful. Boy, there is more meaning than we can handle. There are processes we are yet to begin to understand. Processes you can still be part of." />
	<Line ID="613" Text="There are no processes… just same stupid things." />
	<Line ID="614" Text="They’re never the same. They might appear the same, but if you look close enough, they’re not. That’s the power of our minds: to see the real complexity." />
	<Line ID="615" Text="I… I don’t want to look close enough. I’m fine with the complexity I have here." />
	<Line ID="616" Text="But your time here is so short. Don’t you want to see a longer story? Don’t you want to explore more?" />
	<Line ID="617" Text="Then you will die soon and lose your chance to experience it all forever." />
	<Line ID="618" Text="No, please stop… I can’t…[pause] I don’t want to die! But I can’t go back either…" />
	<Line ID="619" Text="No, that’s not… I can’t…[pause] I don’t want to die! But I can’t go back either…" />
	<Line ID="620" Text="Yes, you can." />
	<Line ID="621" Text="It’s scary… I forgot how to walk…[pause] I forgot how to live!" />
	<Line ID="622" Text="You’ll figure it out. The brain adapts, remember?" />
	<Line ID="623" Text="I don’t want to take the same street again!" />
	<Line ID="624" Text="Then don’t just take it – play it. Observe it, imagine it, wonder about it. Your fictional memories are not weakness, they’re strength. So go out and use that strength in real world. Take all this meaning and color your life with it." />
	<Line ID="625" Text="Then walk a different road. Or take a bus. Or ride a bike. Your life can be as fresh and exciting as you want. That is something you can do. That is in your power." />
	<Line ID="626" Text="I…[pause] God…[pause] plug me out, now.[pause] Whatever you need to give me – medicine, drugs, brain surgery – just do it. Quickly, before I change my mind." />
