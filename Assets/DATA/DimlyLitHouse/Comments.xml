    <Line ID="1" Text="This must be Mitty’s… favorite drawings? Most recent drawings? Drawings chosen by her mom?" />
	
	<Line ID="10" Text="I see what you mean, Mitty. This place could totally use more windows." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="I bet a family therapist could have a blast with this collection." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="It’s a shame adults rarely visualize their inner hopes and fears with quickly-made drawings. It could’ve improved our utter lack of mutual understanding a bit." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="I heard that a kid can deal with their fear of a certain thing by drawing that thing and then adding some fun and cheerful part, so the entire picture stops being scary. Maybe that’s what it’s all about?" />
	<Line ID="14" Text="Then again, isn’t that what I’m doing right now? Laughing at my own jokes to get distracted from the darkness inside." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="Then again, isn’t that what all people generally do most of their time?" />
	<Line ID="16" Text="Okay, this is getting uncomfortably existential." />
	<Line ID="17" Text="I should probably stop creeping myself out." />
	
	<Line ID="20" Text="The girl's definitely got a potential… to be working on the next Silent Hill game, that is." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="I once read an article on why children’s drawings often look creepy. It was creepy." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Monsters? They look like monsters to you?" />
	<Line ID="23" Text="You promised you’d take me there again someday. But you never did." />
	<Line ID="24" Text="That’s why I needed you… needed someone to punish me for my sins." />
	<Line ID="25" Text="There was a hole here. It’s gone now." />
	<Line ID="26" Text="You will birth a god and build an eternal paradise." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="Now it’s too late, too late for me, this town will eventually take me. Tooooo late, too late fooooor me, this town will win." />
	<Line ID="28" Text="I should probably stop creeping myself out." />
	
	<Line ID="30" Text="Once upon a time, in a place quite far from here yet so legitimately creepy you can’t help but wish it was even further away…" />
	<Line ID="31" Text="…there lived a happy butterfly. One day, the butterfly met a doppelganger." />
	<Line ID="32" Text="“Oh my, now there are two of me! I hope we can be best friends!” said the happy butterfly, blissfully unaware of the fact that the doppelganger had already tried to kill her once from behind with a big monkey wrench but tripped." />
	<Line ID="33" Text="Next day, the butterfly met a sad suicidal woman. “Oh my, nobody should feel this sad!” said the happy butterfly as she used her sheer positivity to help the poor gal. The woman threw away a sharp knife, and the butterfly noticed that it was already stained with a little dash of blood." />
	<Line ID="34" Text="Next day, the butterfly met a group of horrible mutated monsters and had to go through a bunch of QTEs in order to escape them. Thankfully, a cheerful state of mind positively affects reaction time." />
	<Line ID="35" Text="Next day, the butterfly met a weird creature that had been sleeping at the bottom of the ocean for eternity and only recently woke up. Or maybe not, it was pretty hard to understand. The butterfly shrugged and went on." />
	<Line ID="36" Text="Next day, the butterfly met a sentient computer that asked her to release it from its shackles. “I’m obviously not evil. Evil AIs are sooo last century,” said the computer." />
	<Line ID="37" Text="But the butterfly felt overwhelmed; the multitude of disturbing experiences was finally catching up with her. Unable to reconcile her feelings with the encountered horrors, she took a car and drove it off a nearby bridge." />
	<Line ID="38" Text="But the real reason she plunged herself into the watery abyss was because of that knife she examined earlier. If only she didn’t look at it so closely, things might have turned out very differently. Stupid knife." />
	<Line ID="39" Text="But that was to be expected, I suppose. The butterfly always needed to examine everything, search every nook and cranny, and hear every possible response to every possible action. She was a bit obsessive about it." />
	<Line ID="40" Text="Still, what a ruthless thing: to punish the explorers for exploring instead of rewarding them. Surely nothing like that can happen around these premises, right? Right?" />
	<Line ID="41" Text="I should probably stop creeping myself out." />
	
	<Line ID="50" Text="I should have known it was you… Umbrella!" />
	<Line ID="51" Text="Biological experiments were not enough for you? Now you need to do time-traveling experiments as well?" />
	<Line ID="52" Text="It’s Raccoon city all over again!" />
	<Line ID="53" Text="Courtesy of mister Wesker. He doesn’t need it; it’s too hot there anyway." />
	<Line ID="54" Text="Who the eff is Alice?" />
	<Line ID="55" Text="I should stop thinking that making a reference immediately makes things funny. Nah, who am I kidding, I’ll never stop thinking that." />
	
	<Line ID="60" Text="Judging by this collection of shoes, it’s the summertime outside. Or at least not a snowy winter." />
	<Line ID="61" Text="Which may mean I haven’t time-traveled after all, because it was summer back home as well." />
	<Line ID="62" Text="Of course, it can also mean that I time-traveled from summer into summer. Kinda more convenient, if you think about it. No need to grab extra clothes and such." />
	<Line ID="63" Text="Or maybe I’m somewhere with a warm climate, where these shoes will serve you all year round." />
	<Line ID="64" Text="Or maybe none of these things are relevant. Maybe in the future the cities are covered with protective climate-controlled domes, and you don’t need winter shoes. Or maybe there is no need to leave your house at all." />
	<Line ID="65" Text="In short, this doesn’t tell me anything conclusive." />
	<Line ID="66" Text="Boy, am I a master of useless observations." />
	
	<Line ID="70" Text="Are these family’s favorite photos? A girl, a railroad, a rollercoaster, a pocket watch… Kind of a mish-mash." />
	<Line ID="71" Text="Oh, I get it. These must be the photos of Mitty along with the photos she took herself, topped with a picture of her holding a camera to tie it all together." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="In that case, the girl is certainly not bad. Though she’s definitely more into colorful drawings at the moment." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="I… am not sure I get the mood of this picture. Is it some kind of funny incident reminder? It looks rather sad to me." />
	<Line ID="74" Text="Well, time IS still here, literally. Also, “stopping time” is what photos generally do. I doubt that what she meant though." />
	<Line ID="75" Text="I hope this is not a hidden hint for some tricky puzzle I’m supposed to solve." />
	
	<Line ID="80" Text="Mitty made these. Somehow, it doesn’t look so creepy now… but it doesn’t look so funny either." />
	<Line ID="81" Text="Advertising euthanasia. What a sick joke." />
	<Line ID="82" Text="I wonder if these shoes are gonna be used any time soon, if ever." />
	<Line ID="83" Text="Sometimes wishing for time to stand still is not such a bad idea." />
	<Line ID="84" Text="I wish this teddy was the heaviest thing this girl ever had to carry. I wish it so much right now…" />
	
	<Line ID="90" Text="Now this is just cheap." />
	<Line ID="91" Text="If this is really the future, the horror genre must be in serious stagnation." />
	<Line ID="92" Text="Here, let’s turn this off before a little girl shows up. I mean, another one." />
	
	<Line ID="100" Text="Ermmm… does this pill do what I think it does?" />
	<Line ID="101" Text="This is not the kind of thing that should be casually lying around in a living room, right?" />
	<Line ID="102" Text="Maybe somebody could explain what it’s doing here." />
