    <Line ID="0" Text="You leave the office together, an unlikely pair of a woman feeling out of place and a man who is about to feel the same.[pause] Excitement and anxiety are battling inside you for attention; you wonder if your ability to drop everything and walk away with the first time-traveling person you’ve met should be considered marvelous, disastrous, ridiculous, or all of these at the same time." />
    <Line ID="1" Text="You make your way through the same alleyways of nearby buildings that must have made Jackie sweat earlier this morning. As back alleys change to busy streets, you notice that her nervousness is starting to return.[pause] After ten minutes of determined crowd-maneuvering you turn into another narrow passage where Jackie produce a miniature device from her pocket, apparently preparing to do whatever she needs to initiate a time jump." />
    <Line ID="2" Text="Five more minutes pass. You’d think the most natural preparation would be to find a secluded corner and make sure nobody’s watching, but she seems more interested in checking her watch than looking around, as if simply standing at a certain spot at a certain time guarantees you privacy.[pause] Then she presses a button on the device, and you close your eyes.[pause] Funny, she didn’t ask you to. You just felt an urge to close your eyes." />
    <Line ID="3" Text="Five more minutes pass. You’d think the most natural preparation would be to find a secluded corner and make sure nobody’s watching, but she seems more interested in checking her watch than looking around, as if simply standing at a certain spot at a certain time guarantees you privacy – no doubt one of her fancy future pre-calculations.[pause] Then she presses a button on the device, and you close your eyes.[pause] Funny, she didn’t ask you to. You just felt an urge to close your eyes." />
	<Line ID="4" Text="And then you find yourself elsewhere. The transition is sudden but so smooth, it feels like waking from a dream.[pause] Was it indeed just a dream? Possible. However, you generally try not to fall asleep in unknown environments, and this dark place certainly qualifies as one.[pause] It looks like somebody’s living room, but there aren’t any people around, and there’s no sign of Jackie either." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="As your eyes adjust to poor illumination, you notice three separate doorways. Perhaps one of them will lead you to some answers – or at least an exit." />
	
	<Line ID="6" Text="The woman rises up from her stool with a huge effort and starts to slowly move toward the kitchen’s door, shaking badly but still maintaining her balance.[pause] You consider giving her a hand, but then conclude it might confuse and weaken her even more." />
	<Line ID="7" Text="It seems to you that each step takes a year, that by the time she gets to the bedroom you will be as old and wrinkled as her mother.[pause] Then again, after the talks about the future in your office, a sudden change of scenery, and this place’s emotional turmoil, your perception of time is too messed up to give it any credit." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="Mitty takes the pill from your outstretched hand and swallows it with ease.[pause] You can see her hand shaking while doing so; in fact, her whole body is shaking, and you convince yourself with all your might that you’ve done the right thing, because this was inevitable, because this poor sick woman wouldn’t hold much longer anyway, because, for all you know, she could have died tomorrow if you haven’t…[pause] if you haven’t…" />
	<Line ID="9" Text="…but then the old lady lies back on her bed as if suddenly asked to, closes her eyes, and doesn’t make a move or sound until her breath finally subsides, an extremely tired but peaceful expression on her face." />
	
	<Line ID="10" Text="You hear a faint clicking noise coming from somewhere in the hallway. The front door you tried so fruitlessly to open before must be unlocked now." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="You hear a faint clicking noise coming from somewhere in the hallway. It appears that something – or someone – has finally unlocked the front door." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="You hear a faint clicking noise coming from the other side of the apartment. It appears that whenever the exit from this place is, it’s unlocked now." />
	
	<Line ID="15" Text="You enter the bedroom just as the woman gets close enough for Mitty to notice her.[pause] The old lady’s eyes light up, and she makes an effort to jump off the bed in excitement like a real little girl would do, but her health quickly betrays her, and she opts for a simple smile of recognition." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="“Mommy!”" />
	<Line ID="17" Text="“Hello, darling…”" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="“Did you come to play?”" />
	<Line ID="19" Text="“I… y-yes…”" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="“Oh, wow! This is so cool! I have so many games in mind, I don’t know where to start!”" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="“Listen, darling… let’s… let’s play a special game.”" />
	<Line ID="22" Text="“What kind of game?”" />
	<Line ID="23" Text="“The game of… switching roles. You will be my mother, and I will be your daughter.”" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="“Okay, that must be fun. But I will be a good and happy mommy. I’m not going to cry, and I will play with my daughter all the time. Let’s play and play and play! Wow, I feel like a great mommy already!”" />
	<Line ID="25" Text="“That’s because you are. I mean, you will be… I mean…”" />
	<Line ID="26" Text="The woman collapses on her knees, unable to hold the weight of her own body any longer, places her head on the old lady’s lap, and starts to shake with silent sobs, but then stops quickly and abruptly, as if left with no energy to produce any movement at all." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="A paralyzing thought crosses you mind that she collapsed for good, or can collapse for good any moment now;[pause] that powers of one broken middle-aged woman are nowhere near enough to hold this twisted experiment for any meaningful amount of time, but you wave this thought away with all your might; you must believe that you’ve done the right thing, you have to believe…" />
	<Line ID="28" Text="…but then the woman falls asleep and her breath gets steady, while the old lady leans a little forward and starts to stroke her new mother’s hair, an affectionate and peaceful expression on her wrinkled face." />
