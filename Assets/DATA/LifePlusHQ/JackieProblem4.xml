  	<Line ID="0" Text="Hey, Michael." />
	<Line ID="1" Text="Hey, no-briefings lady." />
	<Line ID="2" Text="I am so pissed off right now." />
	<Line ID="3" Text="You’re just impossible, you know that?" />
	<Line ID="4" Text="I don’t even have the energy to be mad at you anymore." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="He, I knew you’d be joking about it. That’s the best course of action when you work with someone as stubborn as me.[pause] I hope you understand why this was necessary, though. Why we didn’t wait for you to wake up and connect to VR the usual way." />
	<Line ID="6" Text="That’s impressive. I thought you’d be too spent for anger at this point.[pause] I hope you understand why this was necessary, though. Why we didn’t wait for you to wake up and connect to VR the usual way." />
	<Line ID="7" Text="He, I am fully aware of that, thank you.[pause] I hope you understand why this was necessary, though. Why we didn’t wait for you to wake up and connect to VR the usual way." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="I guess that was part of the plan, he-he.[pause] I hope you understand why this was necessary, though. Why we didn’t wait for you to wake up and connect to VR the usual way." />
	<Line ID="9" Text="Yes. You wanted me to have a similar experience." />
	<Line ID="10" Text="You might as well spell it out." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="I understand, but it doesn’t make me less angry." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="Exactly. To learn that somebody is living inside virtual reality is one thing, but to try it yourself, to understand how real it feels to him… there is no briefing for that." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="I wanted the situation to be relatable, of course. To learn that somebody is living inside virtual reality is one thing, but to try it yourself, to understand how real it feels to him… there is no briefing for that." />
	<Line ID="14" Text="That’s impressive. I thought you’d be too spent for anger at this point." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="But “why” is an easy part. I’m more interested in “how.”" />
	<Line ID="16" Text="Ah, yes… I wasn’t sure it would work, but I’m glad it did." />
	<Line ID="17" Text="Is it some kind of crazy new technology? Simulations directly inside your head?" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="Did you drug me or something? Hypnotized me?" />
	<Line ID="19" Text="It felt so real. I thought you moved me somewhere while I was sleeping." />
	<Line ID="20" Text="More like a crazy natural phenomenon. It was an ordinary VR set, the same one you used yesterday; all we did was quietly slip it on your head at night.[pause] Your brain did the rest. You fell asleep in the real world, so it assumed you woke up in the real world as well." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="No, nothing of the sort. All we did was quietly put a VR set on your head at night.[pause] Your brain did the rest. You fell asleep in the real world, so it assumed you woke up in the real world as well." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Pretty remarkable, right? And all we did was quietly put a VR set on your head at night.[pause] Your brain did the rest. You fell asleep in the real world, so it assumed you woke up in the real world as well." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="A brain can be fooled this easily, huh?" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="So even my exhaustion is an opportunity to you." />
	<Line ID="25" Text="What if it hadn’t worked?" />
	<Line ID="26" Text="You snuck into my room at night, just like that?" />
	<Line ID="27" Text="Weren’t you afraid to wake me up?" />
	<Line ID="28" Text="What about mister Martin? Did he trick himself in a similar way?" />
	<Line ID="29" Text="It happens very rarely, mind you, and it has yet to be properly studied, but it’s a thing.[pause] Other recognized factors include feeling physically or emotionally tired and being unaccustomed to VR experience… both of which apply in your case." />
	<Line ID="30" Text="A good manager should see absolutely everything as an opportunity, don’t you think?" />
	<Line ID="31" Text="Then we would’ve explained the situation to you and proceeded into VR conventionally, even if it meant less chance to relate and emphasize. It was too late to change the entire problem, of course." />
	<Line ID="32" Text="Yep, me and the two technicians you saw down below yesterday. It sounds creepy when I say it… I really apologize for violating your personal space." />
	<Line ID="33" Text="Of course. The whole experiment was relying on our little nighttime shtick, and we didn’t even know how much of a sensitive sleeper you are.[pause] I suppose we could’ve used a sedative to put you in a deeper sleep, but that’s just unethical. No, I counted on the natural sedative effect of other things…[pause] you know, things I’ve been bothering you with for the past four days." />
	<Line ID="34" Text="Sort of. His case was more like continuous deterioration than sudden confusion. He worked at our energy division for 12 years; a quiet, introspective guy, always doing what he’s asked, never complaining…[pause] until he decided to leave. The rest you already know from the recording of his recent conversation with our workers." />
	
	<Line ID="40" Text="Does he live alone?" />
	<Line ID="41" Text="Shouldn’t he have run out of food? Or drown in trash?" />
	<Line ID="42" Text="How did you know that something was wrong with him?" />
	<Line ID="43" Text="You mean he wasn’t sleeping at all?" />
	<Line ID="44" Text="Did he cooperate after that conversation?" />
	<Line ID="45" Text="You kinda tricked him into agreeing, though." />
	<Line ID="46" Text="What’s the deal with the special effects? The black-and-white recordings? The cracks?" />
	<Line ID="47" Text="So just that we’re clear… there was no tragedy in 2036, right?" />
	<Line ID="48" Text="What about the part where his brain was suffering and he could turn into a vegetable? Because he was questioning it." />
	<Line ID="49" Text="So you wanted me to bring him back to the real world." />
	<Line ID="50" Text="So you wanted to bring him back to the real world. Only I didn’t do it. I allowed him to carry on." />
	<Line ID="51" Text="So you wanted to bring him back to the real world. Only it didn’t work. He refused to listen." />
	<Line ID="52" Text="Yes. He was raised in an orphanage, and he’s never been in a relationship. He has a small apartment in Montreal; it belongs to the company, and he retains it indefinitely as a severance benefit." />
	<Line ID="53" Text="It’s all automated these days. You can program your fridge to never run out of ingredients, scheduling drone deliveries through a special delivery entrance so you don’t even have to answer the door.[pause] Your oven will take care of any simple recipe, and cleaning is also not an issue. You don’t have to go out or interact with anyone at all, as long as you have enough money…[pause] and money is usually not a problem for someone who’s worked at LIFE+ for 12 years." />
	<Line ID="54" Text="What a time to be a shut-in." />
	<Line ID="55" Text="It’s a legitimate problem that’s never really got solved. Social uncertainty and pressure are rising while entertainment industry keeps coming up with more and more engaging and exquisite fiction.[pause] He may be uncommon in completely erasing the line between virtual and real, but in terms of sheer desire to escape Harvey’s case is far from unique." />
	<Line ID="56" Text="Simple: online history. Remember our monitoring system? We thought it was glitching, for real.[pause] How can someone stay constantly active in VR services for 22 hours a day? But the human mind keeps surprising us, both with its fragility and flexibility." />
	<Line ID="57" Text="I think he was trying to sleep as little as possible, taking short naps throughout the day at irregular intervals; that’s pretty hard to notice using online records.[pause] A tribe in the Amazon Jungle sleeps like this, or people in the military when under extreme circumstances, but not regular folks. I’m sure his mind welcomed this hazy state of constant sleep deprivation – it was helping to erase the line." />
	<Line ID="58" Text="Yes, and was very helpful; we couldn’t have constructed the simulation without him. Everyone involved saw how much he cherished those memories." />
	<Line ID="59" Text="True. I’m not proud of that, but I think it was necessary. He couldn’t be convinced conventionally… not from the real world, anyway." />
	<Line ID="60" Text="Just a little something to enhance the experience. The idea was to make your conversation about his favorite VR simulations more like a story-driven simulation in itself. I don’t know if it did any good in the end, but it was worth a shot." />
	<Line ID="61" Text="Oh, the asteroid part? That was simply a disaster movie material. The real Apophis safely passed us by both in 2029 and in 2036, just as it was estimated decades ago.[pause] And even if a thing like that was about to hit Earth, the exact location of the impact would be known weeks or months in advance, giving plenty of time to evacuate and minimize damage.[clear]I mean, there are definitely cosmic events that can badly screw us up despite all preparations, but a 300-meter-long asteroid is not one of them." />
	<Line ID="62" Text="What do you think?" />
	<Line ID="63" Text="No… knowing you, it’s probably as accurate as it gets." />
	<Line ID="64" Text="Well, I wouldn’t put it past you to lie, but I don’t see any reason to do so." />
	<Line ID="65" Text="It is. This was the conclusion of our best medical professionals. They’re not always right, but they’re most likely right. We definitely had to act." />
	<Line ID="66" Text="You’re right, there is no reason. This was the conclusion of our best medical professionals. They’re not always right, but they’re most likely right. We definitely had to act." />
	
	<Line ID="75" Text="And you succeeded. Thanks to you, his life doesn’t have to end now; he has many more years of experience ahead. It won’t be only positive experience, but it will be a fulfilling one nonetheless, I’m sure of it.[pause] But that’s just one layer of the story. The other layer is where I simply wonder… is it such a bad thing to seek what he sought?" />
	<Line ID="76" Text="And I am completely fine with it. The important thing is that he was free from confusion long enough to face the truth and make the final choice, which might not have happened without your help.[pause] And when somebody decides on something in their right mind, who am I to judge? After all, I wonder if living like this is such a bad thing…" />
	<Line ID="77" Text="Yeah, your methods of persuasion might’ve been a bit too rough for this particular individual… but hey, I’m not complaining. Whatever you choose, it’s still part of the project.[pause] After all, I wonder if living like him is such a bad thing…" />
	<Line ID="78" Text="Yeah, your methods of persuasion might’ve been a bit too rough for this particular individual… and for some other individuals we’ve encountered during these past few days.[pause] But hey, I’m not complaining. Whatever you choose, it’s still part of the project. After all, I wonder if living like him is such a bad thing…" />
	<Line ID="79" Text="Yeah, I wonder about it myself." />
	<Line ID="80" Text="The only bad thing here is that his brain couldn’t handle it." />
	<Line ID="81" Text="It’s not bad, but it’s misguided. Chasing specific emotions won’t make your life more meaningful." />
	<Line ID="82" Text="What, a life that’s not even real? Are you serious?" />
	<Line ID="83" Text="It’s peculiar, isn’t it? All this man wanted is to squeeze more meaning out of his days.[pause] At the same time, here we are, giving you a taste of the future with the juiciest and most dramatic problems I could find because experiencing the same through routine would be too slow. A somewhat similar goal, don’t you think?" />
	<Line ID="84" Text="None of us are on the brink of coma, though." />
	<Line ID="85" Text="That’s a bit of a forced analogy. “Too slow” is not the main reason; you have many more factors to worry about." />
	<Line ID="86" Text="You’re giving the guy too much credit. He wasn’t trying to “squeeze” anything; he was just running away from the daily grind." />
	<Line ID="87" Text="You’re right. That might be the only difference that matters. Say, hypothetically…[pause] if there were no mental damage to suffer, no side effects to worry about… would you do the same? Would you choose a constructed reality over this one?" />
	<Line ID="88" Text="Still, I can’t help but put this situation into a broader context. I mean, just tell me, hypothetically…[pause] if there were no mental damage to suffer, no side effects to worry about… would you do the same? Would you choose a constructed reality over this one?" />
	<Line ID="89" Text="Maybe, but would he go so far without a lifetime of exciting entertainment waiting one tap away?[pause] And if it was possible for everyone – if there were no mental damage to suffer, no side effects to worry about – how many people would do the same? Would you?" />
	<Line ID="90" Text="I would at least consider the possibility. Reality is subjective anyway, right?" />
	<Line ID="91" Text="Perhaps if my real life gets terrible enough. Right now, thankfully, it’s not." />
	<Line ID="92" Text="Probably not completely, no. If I had two realities, I’d want to explore both of them equally. I’m greedy like that." />
	<Line ID="93" Text="No. I’d rather face my troubles head-on than escape into something simulated." />
	<Line ID="94" Text="That’s a good point. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="95" Text="Fair enough… it takes a lot of “ifs” to answer such a broad question. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="96" Text="I think that’s a good kind of greed. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="97" Text="That’s a very commendable attitude. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="98" Text="I’m afraid that might hold true for every other human brain in existence." />
	<Line ID="99" Text="Maybe that can be changed. Maybe progress will take care of it." />
	<Line ID="100" Text="Perhaps, perhaps not. I think humanity will find out soon." />
	<Line ID="101" Text="You’re probably right. There just has to be a catch." />
	<Line ID="102" Text="So, hypothetically, if there were no mental damage to suffer, no side effects to worry about…[pause] would you do the same? Would you choose a constructed reality over this one?" />
	<Line ID="103" Text="Absolutely. Isn’t that what we do as a species anyway? Even if we concentrate on real life, we still seek every opportunity to make it better. It’s always about “constructing reality.”" />
	<Line ID="104" Text="Probably not completely, no. If I had two realities, I’d want to explore both of them equally. I’m greedy like that." />
	<Line ID="105" Text="Personally? No, I find my real life sufficiently exciting so far. But I might be luckier than most." />
	<Line ID="106" Text="That’s an interesting point… thank you for sharing it with me." />
	<Line ID="107" Text="I think that’s a good kind of greed. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="108" Text="I see your point… thank you for sharing it with me." />
	<Line ID="109" Text="Then what will? Accepting them as they come?" />
	<Line ID="110" Text="Yes, exactly. All emotions are important. Anxiety, sadness, boredom are all essential. If there was no boredom, there would be no works of art. None of the stories he enjoyed so much would be around in the first place." />
	<Line ID="111" Text="Accepting they are not always under your control, at the very least. Finding meaning in all things, because it’s always there, you know. You just have to dig deep enough." />
	<Line ID="112" Text="That’s a very good point… thank you for sharing it with me." />
	<Line ID="113" Text="I think you make a wise point… thank you for sharing it with me." />
	<Line ID="114" Text="Oh, please, Michael, it’s such an outdated argument. What is “real,” anyway?[pause] There is no such thing as objective reality. Whatever happens around, we perceive and interpret it solely through our senses. This whole world could be a computer simulation, and we wouldn’t know any better.[pause] It’s not “I think, therefore I am” anymore – it’s “I think that I think, therefore I think that I am.”[clear]And we have learned it, as society… learned not to rely too much on our preconceived notion of reality and instead choose for ourselves what to consider real. What Harvey did was just an extreme version of this." />
	<Line ID="115" Text="But he couldn’t handle it. His brain started to crack." />
	<Line ID="116" Text="Speak for yourself, will you? I, for one, like my definition of “reality” where it is." />
	<Line ID="117" Text="That is true, and there’s no going around it. I just think, if we put this situation into a broader context…[pause] if, hypothetically, there were no mental damage to suffer, no side effects to worry about… how many people would’ve done the same?" />
	<Line ID="118" Text="Maybe a few, maybe a lot. That doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do." />
	<Line ID="119" Text="Not me, that’s for sure." />
	<Line ID="120" Text="I see your point. Thank you for sharing it with me." />
	<Line ID="121" Text="Yes, that much I understand. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="Fair enough… just because I consider it rational doesn’t mean there aren’t any other opinions. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me." />
	
	<Line ID="130" Text="What happens to mister Martin now?" />
	<Line ID="131" Text="Shall we consider the problem solved, then?" />
	<Line ID="132" Text="We keep helping him, of course, or at least we stay close to be available whenever he accepts our help. Getting back to reality won’t be an easy task.[pause] Eventually, we’ll be glad to have him back as an employee, but we won’t abandon him either way." />
	<Line ID="133" Text="I think we’ll spend a little more time on his case. Nothing involving direct contact; he did explicitly tell us to leave him alone.[pause] We can’t stop deterioration, but we can still try to manage the symptoms… help to squeeze everything out of the remaining months, you know." />
	<Line ID="134" Text="Yeah, I think we’re done for the day. Four down, only one more to go." />
	<Line ID="135" Text="Just one more day working together, eh?" />
	<Line ID="136" Text="Still have one more thing for me, don’t you?" />
	<Line ID="137" Text="Actually, I was about to mention that… in a stunning turn of events, I won’t be your manager tomorrow. You will be solving the last problem together with our CEO." />
	<Line ID="138" Text="Actually, not me personally. In a stunning turn of events, I won’t be your manager tomorrow. You will be solving the last problem together with our CEO." />
	<Line ID="139" Text="Oh, right. You did say something like that earlier." />
	<Line ID="140" Text="That’s unexpected." />
	<Line ID="141" Text="You don’t have to worry about it for now, though.[pause] Right now, we are due for some downtime, so you can get comfortable and have a good rest. See you later!" />
	<Line ID="142" Text="I know, right? You don’t have to worry about it for now, though.[pause] Right now, we are due for some downtime, so you can get comfortable and have a good rest. See you later!" />
