    <Line ID="0" Text="An input area appears on the screen, inviting you to say, draw or type anything you’d like to explore, and you feel a familiar surge of excitement.[pause] Here it is, the ultimate gateway to knowledge and culture, the crown jewel of the glorious information age, still going strong after changing our lives years ago.[pause] This is the place where borders were broken and limitations were lifted; the spot where the last barrier between curiosity and enlightenment fell." />
    <Line ID="1" Text="The pleasant thoughts of possibilities arrive, and you bathe in them. If they want you to familiarize yourself with the world of the future, surely this is where you need to be.[pause] Who needs a pre-constructed set of problems? Who needs an education plan at all? You can just spend here a year or two, surfing through the net, and emerge more powerful than they can possibly imagine.[pause] The knowledge is power, and you have all the keys to handle it. Just try something, anything, and let the flow of data carry you to wonders." />
    <Line ID="2" Text="No… if only it was so simple. Some doors should never be opened; you know that all too well.[pause] Because you won’t settle just for something. Bits of this, pieces of that, a random fact here, a half-understood concept there… no, such fate would be humiliating.[pause] If you start, there is no going back. You are the one who finishes his projects." />
    <Line ID="3" Text="But how can one possibly finish a project with such massive scope? Days will turn into weeks, weeks into months… the flow will never cease; every door will lead to another two, every passage will end with intersections.[pause] Never-ending details will weigh upon you until you are crushed under pressure. No, this task is clearly too overwhelming and daunting to even hope to undertake.[pause] No enlightenment is worth sacrificing mental stability for. You should save yourself while you still can. If you step on this path, nothing but misery waits ahead." />
	<Line ID="4" Text="With steel resolve, you limit yourself to reading the news." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="The rabbit hole of the internet tries to lure you in with unassuming user interface, but you know better than to lose yourself in its gaping madness. Problems first, proper surfing later." />
	
	<Line ID="10" Text="You walk through the door and out of the building to find that the world outside looks just as dark and eerie as the four rooms from before.[pause] A silhouette of what appears to be Jackie nods and waves its hand towards a car so blurred it surely won’t be able to take you anywhere. You take a seat anyway, and much to your surprise the engine roars to life." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="Shadows of skyscrapers start to pass by behind the window, but all of them are just different variations of the mother-turned-daughter and daughter-turned-mother swirling in crazy dances, excited to welcome you into their household as a new family member." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="Shadows of skyscrapers start to pass by behind the window, but all of them keep morphing into wrinkled creatures chanting mesmerizing tunes and swallowing pillows, excited that euthanasia will finally take them to the promised land and urging you to come with them." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="When the dimly lit house finally gives way to reality, you find yourself staring at a city skyline through a window wall, apparently at a high floor of some building.[pause] Jackie stands nearby, looking tense but much more composed and determined than she was back at your office.[pause] It appears she is ready to answer a lot of questions and prepared that some of them won’t be nice. Whatever happened to you was part of the plan." />
	
	<Line ID="20" Text="Chicken chow mein.[pause] Kung pao potatoes.[pause] Egg-fried rice with prawns and peas.[pause] Thai-style fish cakes with cucumber relish.[pause] Spare ribs soup with watercress and apricot kernels.[pause] 11 oz top sirloin steak with sauteed mushrooms, glazed carrots, onion rings, and curry sauce." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="Yes, this is all much better reading than a certain booklet about a certain medicine that’s still assaulting your mental well-being somewhere deep inside.[pause] You go through the menu two more times before pressing the buttons on a “place your order” terminal, settling on some pizza. The next thirty minutes pass in contemplative chewing as you dine alone in a hall full of unused tables." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Upon exiting the cafeteria you are greeted by the same LIFE+ employee who showed you the way here earlier; he gestures towards the passage ahead, inviting you to follow him.[pause] You make a feeble attempt at small talk while the two of you walk through empty corridors, but all your questions get deflected with polite suggestions to consult the project manager." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="A few minutes later you open another door and find yourself in a small hotel-type room. This is where you’re supposed to rest and sleep before plunging into the unknown again." />
