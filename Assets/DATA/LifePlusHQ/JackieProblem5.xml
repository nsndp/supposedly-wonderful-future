  	<Line ID="0" Text="Good morning, Michael." />
	<Line ID="1" Text="Good morning once again." />
	<Line ID="2" Text="And to you, Jackie. Shame it’ll be my last one here." />
	<Line ID="3" Text="You bet it is! After all, it’s the day I finally get done with this thing." />
	<Line ID="4" Text="You keep saying that. I don’t think any of them were good." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="Are you excited to meet the big boss?" />
	<Line ID="6" Text="I feel the same way. Are you excited to meet the big boss?" />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Yeah, I’m sure you can barely hold a triumphant hooray. How do you feel about meeting the big boss? Interested?" />
	<Line ID="8" Text="Well, you are certainly entitled to your opinion. All I can say is that we tried our best. How do you feel about meeting the big boss? Interested?" />
	<Line ID="9" Text="I guess so. It should be educating to meet a businessman of such caliber." />
	<Line ID="10" Text="Nah, he’s probably an ass. All the quota of nice people in this story was already used up on you." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="I don’t really have any expectations." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="I think you can count on that." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="Aw, what a sweet thing to say." />
	<Line ID="14" Text="You’ve earned it. I really enjoyed our time together these past days." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="It wasn’t such a big quota to begin with, mind you. One might even call it tiny." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="Thank you. And allow me to say that it’s mutual." />
	<Line ID="17" Text="Yeah, I think I’ll ignore that part and concentrate on the compliment." />
	<Line ID="18" Text="That’s probably wise." />
	<Line ID="19" Text="Any tips on the final problem?" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="Are we meeting somewhere around here?" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="Well, it might be weird and sudden and surprising, but I’m sure you’re pretty much used to it at this point." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Sure, on this very floor. See the passage to my left?[pause] What you need to do is walk through it and just continue down the corridor until you see an imposing-looking door. There’ll be a nameplate attached nearby, stating that it’s the office of the CEO, such and such… pretty hard to miss." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="Aren’t you going with me?" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="No, the boss left specific instructions to make you approach him alone. I’m pretty much on holiday today.[pause] The first one in many months of crunch, actually… yeah, that’ll be a forgotten feeling." />
	<Line ID="25" Text="Will we meet again?" />
	<Line ID="26" Text="In general? I think it’s entirely up to you. But not during this project, no. My work here, wordy and protracted as it was, is done now." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="So it’s kind of a goodbye time, eh?" />
	<Line ID="28" Text="Yep. It’s that part of the story where we say how mere four days of one adventure have changed our lives forever and then tearfully fall into each other’s embrace." />
	<Line ID="29" Text="I don’t think it’s that kind of story." />
	<Line ID="30" Text="I thought you said this was a job, not an adventure." />
	<Line ID="31" Text="Nooooooo thank you." />
	<Line ID="32" Text="And here I was, ready to confess my feelings in a dignified, trope-respecting way." />
	<Line ID="33" Text="Yeah, you’re right, of course. But at least it’s a story where I end up telling a bad joke.[pause] I usually don’t tell my worst jokes to people unless I feel really comfortable around them… and that joke was damn awful. So that’s something, right?" />
	<Line ID="34" Text="You know, it was much more adventurous that I ever expected. I even get to tell a bad joke.[pause] I usually don’t tell my worst jokes to people unless I feel really comfortable around them… and that joke was damn awful. So that’s something, right?" />
	<Line ID="35" Text="Relax, it’s just a joke. But hey, you know what?[pause] I usually don’t tell my worst jokes to people unless I feel really comfortable around them… and that joke was damn awful. So that’s something, right?" />
	<Line ID="36" Text="Yeah, and I just went and made a horrible joke. Totally ruined the moment.[pause] But you know what? I usually don’t tell my worst jokes to people unless I feel really comfortable around them… and that joke was damn awful. So that’s something, right?" />
	<Line ID="37" Text="Yeah… that’s something." />
	<Line ID="38" Text="Good thing the cells renewal is around, too. It could’ve been much worse if it wasn’t. You could’ve been stuck with a 61-year-old grandma as your guide." />
	<Line ID="39" Text="Now you’re just messing around." />
	<Line ID="40" Text="That’s pure conjecture." />
	<Line ID="41" Text="Still, just imagine: old toothless Jackie sitting in a rickety chair, cursing her decrepit aching bones, screaming at kids to get off the grass or something." />
	<Line ID="42" Text="You’re overdramatizing. Sixty one is not nearly as old." />
	<Line ID="43" Text="Not a very pleasant sight, to be sure." />
	<Line ID="44" Text="The lawn. If you’re looking for an old American idiom, it’s “get off my lawn.”" />
	<Line ID="45" Text="I thought you weren’t into this whole stereotyping thing." />
	<Line ID="46" Text="Perhaps you’re right. Everyone is different, of course. I should’ve found out what kind of an old lady I am by now; only it didn’t happen.[pause] And it feels… weird. Even years down the road, it feels so very weird…[clear]I… I hope I played my part as well as I could. I hope you can see this future like I try to see it myself.[pause] It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s not bad either. It’s neither fair nor unfair, neither fixed nor broken, neither random nor predetermined, neither crazy nor sane – it’s all of these things at the same time." />
	<Line ID="47" Text="Exactly. But it didn’t happen to me. Millennia of history tell me that it should, but it didn’t.[pause] And it feels… weird. Even years down the road, it feels so very weird…[clear]I… I hope I played my part as well as I could. I hope you can see this future like I try to see it myself.[pause] It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s not bad either. It’s neither fair nor unfair, neither fixed nor broken, neither random nor predetermined, neither crazy nor sane – it’s all of these things at the same time." />
	<Line ID="48" Text="See? I’m completely uneducated on what it means to be an old person. I should’ve been an old person myself by now, only it didn’t happen.[pause] And it feels… weird. Even years down the road, it feels so very weird…[clear]I… I hope I played my part as well as I could. I hope you can see this future like I try to see it myself.[pause] It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s not bad either. It’s neither fair nor unfair, neither fixed nor broken, neither random nor predetermined, neither crazy nor sane – it’s all of these things at the same time." />
	<Line ID="49" Text="I know, right? Definitely not my best moment. I’m so uneducated on what it means to be an old person, it’s embarrassing. I should’ve been an old person myself by now, only it didn’t happen.[pause] And it feels… weird. Even years down the road, it feels so very weird…[clear]I… I hope I played my part as well as I could. I hope you can see this future like I try to see it myself.[pause] It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s not bad either. It’s neither fair nor unfair, neither fixed nor broken, neither random nor predetermined, neither crazy nor sane – it’s all of these things at the same time." />
	<Line ID="50" Text="That’s a good way to look at the world." />
	<Line ID="51" Text="I think you’ve managed to carry that across." />
	<Line ID="52" Text="I disagree, but I understand your point." />
	<Line ID="53" Text="I appreciate you saying that. Honestly, I don’t want to shove my views down anyone’s throat; that would be a horrible thing to do. I just think it’s the truth, and I believe it with all my heart.[clear]And who knows, maybe even that will change. Maybe one day our world will become an honest trouble-free paradise, or turn into a living post-apocalyptic hell, or succumb to any other simple, convenient narrative…[pause] but until then, this is the real thing. The best thing we’ve managed to build. Our beautiful, complicated mess.[clear]And Michael? Thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done. I wish you all the luck in this world of 2048, or that world of 2018, or any other world you might find yourself in. Be well." />
	<Line ID="54" Text="You too, Jackie. You too." />
	<Line ID="55" Text="Thanks, I’ll try." />
