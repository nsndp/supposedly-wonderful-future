    <Line ID="1" Text="Ah, the modern art." />
	<Line ID="2" Text="The coffee cup is undoubtedly the centerpiece of this composition, capturing the mood of a fulfilling breakfast before a productive and eventful day." />
	<Line ID="3" Text="However, it is the glass of water that makes this work truly remarkable." />
	<Line ID="4" Text="A puzzled viewer might ask: why is it standing there? Don’t coffee and water both count as drinks in a traditional meal structure, and therefore serve roughly the same purpose? Why would you need two different drinks at the same time?" />
	<Line ID="5" Text="Or could it be that the unnamed hero of this work hasn’t decided on a beverage yet? Could it be that the glass of water represents a choice?" />
	<Line ID="6" Text="The morning cup looks inviting and alluring, but does your body really need caffeine right now? Is that fleeting surge of energy worth disrupting your inner clock for? The nature spent millions of years perfecting circadian rhythms, and now you’re going to mess with it just to feel a bit less sleepy?" />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Perhaps we should listen to our bodies and respect their phases instead of forcing them to keep up with the frantic pace of modern society. Perhaps we should realize that the choices hidden around us – sometimes behind a thing so simple as a glass of water – are more important than we think." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="This is refreshing in a number of ways." />
		
	<Line ID="10" Text="I like how down-to-earth the future of design turned out to be." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="It’s always nice when the culture of aesthetics is recognizing the real values in life." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="Waterfalls and rainbows may be pretty, but they seriously lack nutrition value." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="Hey, maybe one of my lunches is now hanging in someone’s living room? Because I used to post a lot them on Instagram." />
	<Line ID="14" Text="The people of the future have spoken! They choose simplicity! The people who decorated this room, anyway." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="You think this stuff is paid for by foodservice distributors? It’s a very shrewd form of advertising, making people glance at your products for hours on end." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="Food for thoughts, thoughts for food." />
	
	<Line ID="20" Text="HP replenished! Can I go fight the last boss now?" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="An apple a day keeps the doctor away… unless you’re underleveled. In that case, they just one-shot you with no chance to heal and you have to start all over again because it’s a roguelike but nobody warned you." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="I wish it could keep away the project manager too." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="Magical banana! Banana reminds me of yellow! Yellow reminds me of the sun! The sun reminds me of infinite cosmos! Infinite cosmos reminds me of my utter insignificance! My utter insignificance reminds me of my existential crisis! Hey!" />
