	<Line ID="1" Text="You again? What on earth has happened?" />
	<Line ID="2" Text="So I wasn’t dreaming after all." />
	<Line ID="3" Text="What the hell was it, then?" />
	<Line ID="4" Text="I imagine you are about to give me some explanation." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="The first problem." />
	<Line ID="6" Text="No. Sorry." />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Actually, I thought we could both do an equal amount of explaining. This way we can extract more value out of the first problem." />
	
	<Line ID="10" Text="What? You’re joking. What kind of problem is THAT?" />
	<Line ID="11" Text="Is this some kind of game? Did you come into my office to screw with my head?" />
	<Line ID="12" Text="This was… ruthless." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="I should have expected something like this the moment I agreed to your sweet deal." />
	<Line ID="14" Text="You are a woman of some nerve, talking like this after leaving me locked up in that place." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="A real kind." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="A real kind? More like a sick kind! You people are all crazy here!" />
	<Line ID="17" Text="Michael, please try to calm down. I will answer all your questions, but you need to ask them first." />
	<Line ID="18" Text="No, I came into your office to invite you to the future. You agreed to travel, and then you did." />
	<Line ID="19" Text="Oh, that’s funny. Maybe I’m just a little bit confused because you promised A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING!" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="And I agreed to solve your problems even though you refused to tell me anything about them. What an idiot." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="Taking a leap of faith doesn’t make you an idiot.[pause] You trusted me, and I promise I’ll make sure that trust was not misplaced. There is meaning behind this, and we are going to explore it." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="But necessary. I promise it wasn’t just to make you suffer. There is meaning behind this, and we are going to explore it." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="You didn’t know what to expect; that was part of the deal.[pause] But I promise it wasn’t just to make you suffer. There is meaning behind this, and we are going to explore it." />
	<Line ID="24" Text="Oh… I’m sorry if that sounded too harsh, Michael. I know it was a very challenging experience.[pause] But I promise it wasn’t just to make you suffer. There is meaning behind this, and we are going to explore it." />
	
	<Line ID="30" Text="Was it even real? How did I appear in that house right when you pressed the button? How come you were with me before but not after?" />
	<Line ID="31" Text="But why did you throw me there straight away? Why not explain things first?" />
	<Line ID="32" Text="I thought you people were immortal here. How come the very first thing I had to deal with was a terminal illness case?" />
	<Line ID="33" Text="You lied to me! You said that all problems will be perfectly solvable." />
	<Line ID="34" Text="I thought I was coming to a utopia, not a horror freak show!" />
	<Line ID="35" Text="Why me? It was a job for a therapist. I write code for a living!" />
	<Line ID="36" Text="Do you expect me to shrug this thing off? To wake up tomorrow and carry on like nothing’s happened?" />
	<Line ID="37" Text="Is that everything?" />
	<Line ID="38" Text="I programmed our time-traveling routes this way. The technology allows us to define a destination very precisely. You appeared in that room; I appeared elsewhere." />
	<Line ID="39" Text="And then you closed the door and watched." />
	<Line ID="40" Text="Yes, I did. That part was for you alone to experience. But I am helping you now. We will get closure together." />
	<Line ID="41" Text="Because real problems don’t wait till you finish a tutorial or pass a briefing. They come and punch you in the face, and then they stay with you until and unless you solve them." />
	<Line ID="42" Text="Not immortal, Michael. We simply possess technology to prevent aging and decrease the chances of most age-related diseases. When these diseases happen anyway, however, it’s an entirely different story.[pause] We still bleed and suffer from injuries, can be shot or stabbed. “Immortality” might be a wrong word here altogether." />
	<Line ID="43" Text="Yet you didn’t object to that word when recruiting me." />
	<Line ID="44" Text="Just like all of our media today. Humanity likes to celebrate its achievements, and it has every right to do so, in this particular case more than ever.[pause] However you call it, it is still a wonder. For the first time in history, we are able to cheat death." />
	<Line ID="45" Text="Yes, and that you can solve them with your mind. Which is exactly what you did." />
	<Line ID="46" Text="I didn’t solve it! I couldn’t solve it. There was nothing left to solve! Only to watch… and suffer with them." />
	<Line ID="47" Text="I killed a person! That wasn’t a solution!" />
	<Line ID="48" Text="I encouraged a sick and delusional game! That wasn’t a solution!" />
	<Line ID="49" Text="You gave closure to a woman who was so mentally paralyzed and overwhelmed she couldn’t get up from her chair. This is a solution. You made a difference back there." />
	<Line ID="50" Text="I never said this future was perfect. The better the world appears, the more important it is to look its problems straight in the eye. Humanity didn’t come this far by being complacent." />
	<Line ID="51" Text="So this is the price? You’re going to put me through hell before I can live here?" />
	<Line ID="52" Text="No, we’re going to put you through all kinds of things. But it is important to understand that even immortality won’t solve all the troubles in the world, or you’re in for a big disappointment." />
	<Line ID="53" Text="Outsider’s perspective. By knowing next to nothing about this time and place, you possess no bias and no prejudice.[pause] You have no idea how valuable it is to have an unbiased mind in a team. With years we’ve come to appreciate that." />
	<Line ID="54" Text="No, but we expect you to keep functioning, and we’d really like you to unload emotional baggage between the problems, so you can face each one of them with a clear head.[pause] I know it’s a big thing to ask, and it won’t be easy, but the result is worth it. The help that you can bring this world is worth it." />
	
	<Line ID="60" Text="Almost. We just need to discuss what happened back in the house." />
	<Line ID="61" Text="Oh, please, enough damage is done for one day." />
	<Line ID="62" Text="All right… say what you have to say." />
	<Line ID="63" Text="Fine, then maybe you can do some actual explaining." />
	<Line ID="64" Text="Damage, perhaps; understanding, not yet. You gave that woman a closure. Now you need it yourself." />
	<Line ID="65" Text="Well, you already know the premise. At first, there was an old woman diagnosed with a late stage of Alzheimer's disease, and the newest medical advancements that could cure it… but it didn’t work.[pause] And then it was her desperate daughter who asked the doctors for that last sad bit of help: to let her mother go peacefully." />
	<Line ID="66" Text="Yes, that much she managed to tell me." />
	<Line ID="67" Text="But even in a society where euthanasia is officially allowed, you need to make sure there is no other option left. Physical healing made way for counseling; different doctors came and tried helping her to cope.[pause] Then another specialist arrived to see if she at least possessed mental capacity to choose euthanasia in good conscience. She hadn’t, of course; the pressure was becoming too much for the poor woman.[clear]Yet the status quo proved impossible to keep as well: she was slipping out of reality along with her mother. The tension had to be released, even if it meant making this decision for them.[pause] That’s when I discovered the case and quickly picked it up." />
	<Line ID="68" Text="And so you called “the man from the agency.”" />
	<Line ID="69" Text="Yes, and prepared a pill for you to find and possibly use; placed it on her table right before you arrived." />
	<Line ID="70" Text="But why? I couldn’t possibly make things more right than an entire group of medical professionals." />
	<Line ID="71" Text="It sounds like you just grabbed someone else’s problem and used it for your own little experiment." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="I honestly believe you could. It’s not just about your perspective; it’s about… little things. Being a professional is important, yet it’s easy to forget what simple genuine empathy can do.[pause] But you remembered. I’m really proud of how you handled this." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="Perhaps I did. I used the corporate power to intervene, there’s no denying that. Forced you to do the solving so you can learn from it and we can learn from you.[pause] But I honestly believe we brought some good as well. Being a medical professional is important, yet it’s easy to forget what simple genuine empathy can do. I try to create win-win situations, even when “win” is not an appropriate word." />
	
	<Line ID="75" Text="So her mother did have Alzheimer's disease." />
	<Line ID="76" Text="I still don’t understand how surgery could screw up her mind in such a strange way." />
	<Line ID="77" Text="I must admit though, she really put me off with her hatred for kids." />
	<Line ID="78" Text="The woman said that the surgery had 90% chance of success. Is it for real?" />
	<Line ID="79" Text="So, what happens now?" />
	
	<Line ID="85" Text="Yes." />
	<Line ID="86" Text="And she was old." />
	<Line ID="87" Text="Yes." />
	<Line ID="88" Text="Does that mean she couldn’t afford your “immortality”?" />
	<Line ID="89" Text="No. Maybe she just decided not to do it." />
	<Line ID="90" Text="Decided not to be immortal?" />
	<Line ID="91" Text="Still, the risk probably increases with each passing year. If she went through the renewal as soon as possible… maybe none of this would’ve happened." />
	<Line ID="92" Text="Is that so? I’m sure it’s easy to overlook that your renewal is only available to those who can pay for it." />
	<Line ID="93" Text="And so humanity gets another way to split into “us” and “them.” Another way to start hating each other." />
	<Line ID="94" Text="I have another question." />
	<Line ID="95" Text="Maybe. Or maybe she was planning to do it later on. The renewal can’t make you young again; it can only “maintain” your age.[pause] So, as long as you’re not too old for the procedure, a couple of years won’t make much difference. 63 or 65, it doesn’t really matter." />
	<Line ID="96" Text="That only makes sense in retrospective. There are less known but equally ruthless illnesses that target young people or people in their prime. Or accidents that has nothing to do with your age.[pause] You can’t really predict the killing blow… you just take your chances." />
	<Line ID="97" Text="Well, what do you want from me? Of course it costs money, and of course it’s not that simple. We try to make it as cheap as we can, as accessible in every part of the world as we can. Some people still can’t afford that.[pause] Then again, some people don’t even want it. They shove it back in our face and die with a smile on their lips, pitying us." />
	<Line ID="98" Text="No, that is not how it goes. This dystopia exists only in the minds of those who want to believe in it, I can guarantee that much." />
	<Line ID="99" Text="Sure." />
	<Line ID="100" Text="I’m no neurosurgeon myself, but I’m pretty sure any treatment of Alzheimer’s late stages must include some memory-related manipulation because recollections are already affected by the disease.[pause] Some say it’s still a volatile process that can, in rare cases, spiral out of control and just unhinge things instead of ordering them. Then again, human mind always tries to make sense of stuff, even if working with completely irrational data.[pause] Being a little girl was probably the most reasonable conclusion from the remaining mess." />
	
	<Line ID="105" Text="Oh, I can give you some context for that. She has a grown-up son, but their relationship's a mess, and they haven’t talked once in about ten years." />
	<Line ID="106" Text="That bad, huh?" />
	<Line ID="107" Text="What? Great, so it was a coping mechanism." />
	<Line ID="108" Text="That still doesn’t justify the hatred." />
	<Line ID="109" Text="Is there anything about that woman’s life that doesn’t scream drama?" />
	<Line ID="110" Text="I have another question." />
	<Line ID="111" Text="It’s very bad, from what I could gather. The fact that she hates her son’s guts was probably the most consistent thing the doctors heard from her.[pause] As for the son, they tried to contact him many times to no avail; I also called him myself, but he just said he doesn’t care in the most casual voice possible.[pause] I didn’t back down right after that, of course, but in the end my convincing skills were clearly insufficient." />
	<Line ID="112" Text="And a very effective one. All her hard work at raising another person amounted to nothing, so she threw away the whole idea and decided that it’s a waste of time anyway.[pause] She also embraced the promise of scientific immortality. Sadly for her, immortality is still hiding around the corner." />
	<Line ID="113" Text="It’s just her way to deal with it, Michael. When they broke up for good, she started with denial, and then she cemented this denial by thinking that raising kids is someone’s cruel joke.[pause] She said some nasty things since then, and it’s tempting to hate her, but remember that cruel words often come from those who feel hurt the most." />
	<Line ID="114" Text="There is. She’s from a small but wealthy family, and they traveled all around the world when she was younger. She had a happy marriage that ended in a divorce, but a surprisingly peaceful, “let’s remain friends” divorce.[pause] It is very easy to perceive a mixed bag of life as predominantly happy or predominantly sad." />
	<Line ID="115" Text="Sure." />
	
	<Line ID="120" Text="Of course. They don’t take the numbers off the top of their heads; I’m sure it’s as accurate as any calculated probability can be today.[pause] There are very precise computer simulations of medical procedures to give you a representative sample even before first volunteers come through your door. It means that 9 out of every 10 patients are cured, nothing less." />
	<Line ID="121" Text="But that’s… really unlucky." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="Mathematically speaking, it has nothing to do with luck. Speaking as a human being, though… yeah, it sucks.[pause] But our doctors make sure to carry the message across. They will never accept anybody for experimental treatment unless they completely understand the meaning behind the numbers. That woman knew the risks." />
	<Line ID="123" Text="She still signed up for it." />
	<Line ID="124" Text="Then why did she agree?" />
	<Line ID="125" Text="And who can blame her? If you could see probabilities of your daily activities, how many 90% chances would you take each day? 80% chances? 70% chances?[pause] People are going with such risks all the time, and then some. We just hope that the dice roll favors us, but it doesn’t have to. The dice doesn’t care about us at all." />
	<Line ID="126" Text="Because the alternative was even worse. Can you really blame her? If you could see probabilities of your daily activities, how many 90% chances would you take each day? 80% chances? 70% chances?[pause] People are going with such risks all the time, and then some. We just hope that the dice roll favors us, but it doesn’t have to. The dice doesn’t care about us at all." />
	<Line ID="127" Text="Yeah. Probability is a bitch." />
	<Line ID="128" Text="Well, maybe there are forces behind the dice that do." />
	<Line ID="129" Text="You could say that. We brought so much certainty to our lives, yet sometimes it’s still just us and the random number generator of the universe." />
	<Line ID="130" Text="Yeah, maybe… but apparently, even they decided not to help her." />
	
	<Line ID="140" Text="Now we can try to relax. One of our employees will come and show you the way to the cafeteria, where you can experience our fine futuristic cuisine.[pause] I’m kidding, it’s not really futuristic; just a bit more fusion-esque, maybe." />
	<Line ID="141" Text="Aren’t you gonna join me? Maybe we could chat about some less work-related themes." />
	<Line ID="142" Text="Aren’t you gonna join me? You seemed pretty intent on following me everywhere so far." />
	<Line ID="143" Text="Finally, some change of scenery. And some rest from you. You know, as the main part of that scenery." />
	<Line ID="144" Text="No, sorry. I kinda just eat sandwiches right here during projects while I keep looking at the files.[pause] There's usually so much left to prepare and finalize, I wouldn’t have enough time if I was chilling at the cafeteria." />
	<Line ID="145" Text="No, I don’t have time for a proper meal, to be honest. There is so much left to prepare and finalize during projects, I just sit here, eat sandwiches, and keep working." />
	<Line ID="146" Text="Sounds like you’re really busy." />
	<Line ID="147" Text="Oh, I see." />
	<Line ID="148" Text="Well, I signed up for it. And I knew beforehand that I won’t be getting much help, with all this secrecy about time traveling and stuff…[pause] It’s all right, I enjoy a frantic pace every once in a while. Makes you feel alive. Very tired, but alive." />
	<Line ID="149" Text="Yeah, that’s familiar." />
	<Line ID="150" Text="The “feel alive” part is probably worth it." />
	<Line ID="151" Text="Whatever." />
	<Line ID="152" Text="But we can definitely have a more casual chat if you’d like; that’s a time that won’t be wasted.[pause] Take an elevator back after you finish – chances are, I’ll still be around, working. Just don’t forget to check your room first." />
	<Line ID="153" Text="Yeah, yeah, I’m glad you’re excited about something, at least.[pause] On the off chance you decide to learn more after all, I’ll be right here, burning the midnight oil. Just don’t run away from your guide – he’ll also show where your room is." />
	<Line ID="154" Text="My room? Shouldn’t you drive me to a hotel for the night or something?" />
	<Line ID="155" Text="We have rooms right here. They are hotel rooms, for all intents and purposes, only…" />
	<Line ID="156" Text="…only you can keep an eye on me 24/7." />
	<Line ID="157" Text="Yes. Also, we won’t waste time on transportation, so there will be more left for sleep." />
	<Line ID="158" Text="Are these LIFE+ offices?" />
	<Line ID="159" Text="Can I wander around the rest of the building?" />
	<Line ID="160" Text="How do you even have my fingerprints?" />
	<Line ID="161" Text="So I’m safely locked up at all times." />
	<Line ID="162" Text="Yeah, right." />
	<Line ID="163" Text="Yes, we’re currently at the 29th floor of our corporate headquarters. This is our base of operations for the rest of the project.[pause] Here, we can discuss our work in the evening and have briefings in the morning… there will be some of the latter too, I promise." />
	<Line ID="164" Text="No, sorry. You only have access to this floor and the floor below, where your room and the cafeteria are." />
	<Line ID="165" Text="I can just press a different button in the elevator, you know." />
	<Line ID="166" Text="You certainly can. It will scan your fingerprint, check it with our systems for security clearance, and refuse to move." />
	<Line ID="167" Text="We took it from an old database. Something about a trip to Brazil? It’s not easy to exist in the 21st century without leaving your fingers behind." />
	<Line ID="168" Text="But they said they delete them after the visit." />
	<Line ID="169" Text="I imagine they tried. But you know how hard it is to completely delete something." />
	<Line ID="170" Text="Please don’t take it the wrong way. Each person you interact with is another chance of affecting this timeline and therefore another set of complex calculations for us. We just have to keep it manageable." />
	<Line ID="171" Text="What about people at the cafeteria?" />
	<Line ID="172" Text="There’s nobody around there at this hour, and the service is automated. Actually, the place is hardly used at all.[pause] I don’t even remember which one of the execs insisted that “folks from the top floors” need their own place to chow… but clearly, it wasn’t a very good idea." />
	<Line ID="173" Text="Oh, there is also an access point in your room, so you can go online if you want. You know, read the news, visit websites…[pause] there’s one daily newspaper I put in your favorites, it’s reasonably good. Better than my convoluted explanations, anyway." />
	<Line ID="174" Text="Hold on a second. One does not simply give me access to the internet of the future and then expect that I will spend more time on sleep." />
	<Line ID="175" Text="Shall I go, then?" />
	<Line ID="176" Text="I’m sure you can find reasonable balance." />
	<Line ID="177" Text="Sure. And thank you for today, really. This might be our most ambitious and exciting project to date, and I’m grateful that you’ve agreed to make it possible. Have a good night." />
