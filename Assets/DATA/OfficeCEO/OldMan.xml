  	<Line ID="0" Text="Hello, my friend. It’s so good to finally have you here." />
  	<Line ID="1" Text="Eh… thanks, I guess…" />
	<Line ID="2" Text="What’s going on here? Who are you?" />
	<Line ID="3" Text="You look confused. Perhaps I can provide some clarification?" />
	<Line ID="4" Text="About that sign at the entrance…" />
	<Line ID="5" Text="The sign? Why, it’s only there to mention whose office it is. Nothing unusual, don’t you think?" />
	<Line ID="6" Text="But that’s my name." />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Is it? Do we share the same name? What a peculiar turn of events." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="No, that’s not right… stop playing around with me." />
	<Line ID="9" Text="Peculiar, my ass." />
	<Line ID="10" Text="Oh, I’m sorry. I couldn’t help but savor your bewilderment for a moment. But isn’t it obvious? You are me, and I am you." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="Oh, please, don’t get mad so early on; I apologize. I just couldn’t help but savor your bewilderment for a moment. But isn’t it obvious? You are me, and I am you." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="Didn’t Jackie tell you about me? I’m the CEO of LIFE+. The man who brought you to the future." />
	<Line ID="13" Text="That’s not what I meant. Why do you have my name written at the entrance?" />
	<Line ID="14" Text="Is this a setup for another wacky problem? Am I supposed to be a CEO today?" />
	<Line ID="15" Text="Oh, that’s my name written there. We just happen to have the same name. We also happen to be the same person." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="My friend, you’ve been a CEO for 25 years now. Of course, you wouldn’t know that… unlike me, you skipped them in a time jump. But that’s pretty much the only difference between us." />
	<Line ID="17" Text="What?" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="Unless you think it’s just a coincidence. But you are too observational for that, aren’t you? Look closely at my face. Listen to my voice. So familiar, it’s unsettling." />
	<Line ID="19" Text="But how?" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="Oh. Crap." />
	<Line ID="21" Text="You’re from the past, remember? A younger, 29-year-old version of me. I ordered to bring you here.[pause] They say I employ the best scientists in the world, but even I didn’t expect them to figure out freaking time traveling… well, once they did, I decided to use the first field test for something special." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="That’s not what I was told." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="Of course it wasn’t. I had to lure you in. Invent something spicy, something with an adventure flavor, like you love. Solving mysterious problems, for example." />
	<Line ID="24" Text="But… joining you in a perfect future? Preventing my own death? Being the most suitable candidate? All lies?" />
	<Line ID="25" Text="You son of a bitch." />
	<Line ID="26" Text="Convenient, isn’t it? I am you. I know exactly what kind of lies you need, what kind of questions you ask before getting on board.[pause] You didn’t stand a chance. Your agreement was certain the moment Jackie crossed your doorstep." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="But we talked so much about it. She gave me all kinds of details. She had an answer for every question…" />
	<Line ID="28" Text="Please. Do you think it’s so hard to spin the story as you go along? That what she does for life: convincing others of stuff, regardless of whether it’s true or not. Hell, that’s what she does to herself." />
	<Line ID="29" Text="Why did you bring me here then?" />
	<Line ID="30" Text="To kill me." />
	<Line ID="31" Text="Excuse me?" />
	<Line ID="32" Text="I need you to take this gun and shoot me. I decided to quit. In a specific way." />
	<Line ID="33" Text="What? Why would I do such a thing? Why would you WANT such a thing?" />
	<Line ID="34" Text="Because there is nothing left for me. Because I owe the universe that much. Because we are still the same person, and I’m sure you’ll understand. You must to." />
	
	<Line ID="40" Text="Are you saying you wish to commit a suicide? But why?" />
	<Line ID="41" Text="I won’t understand anything unless you start to explain." />
	<Line ID="42" Text="Oh, “why” is a satisfying question, isn’t it? It promises you reason, even if there was none to begin with. I’ve been asking it my entire life. Why can’t I just… ugh…" />
	<Line ID="43" Text="Ah, explaining is good, isn’t it? It promises you reason, even if there was none to begin with. I’ve been looking for explanations my entire life. Why can’t I just… ugh…" />
	<Line ID="45" Text="Are you okay?" />
	<Line ID="46" Text="Finish your thought, old man." />
	<Line ID="47" Text="…you know what, this is kinda hard. I’ve been rehearsing, but now I suddenly don’t feel like talking. You sure you don’t wanna just grab the gun, shoot me, and get it over with?" />
	<Line ID="48" Text="No!" />
	<Line ID="49" Text="What do you think?" />
	<Line ID="50" Text="No, of course not. Oh, very well. Do you ever feel like… the universe is mocking you?" />
	<Line ID="51" Text="What kind of question is that?" />
	<Line ID="52" Text="I feel like it’s mocking me all the time. All the good things that happen to me, all the wonders that surround me; it knows I will never be able to appreciate them, but keeps giving anyway, and laughs: “See how great your life is?”" />
	<Line ID="53" Text="Eh…" />
	<Line ID="54" Text="Let me tell you a story. I hope Jackie told you enough interesting stories, because this one is really fucking boring. It’s about a man who used to ask a lot of questions.[pause] “Why this,” and “what if that,” and “how does it work,” and “what do you mean,” and so on… or maybe he wasn’t asking them aloud, but he was always considering it. You know the reason?" />
	<Line ID="55" Text="Trying to understand?" />
	<Line ID="56" Text="Seeing everything there is to see?" />
	<Line ID="57" Text="I’m afraid to even guess." />
	<Line ID="58" Text="Precisely. He wanted things around him to make sense. But you know what he discovered later on? They don’t.[pause] Even after you ask hundreds of questions, the world makes no freaking sense at all. And it felt so… fruitless. I mean, this desire to understand, it comes from somewhere. Some fire inside you ignites it.[pause] But if everything amounts to nothing, there’s no point to keep it burning. So the man let the fire die out… and went on to live with the ashes." />
	<Line ID="59" Text="Yes, in a way. Only it was not enough to see; he wanted things to make sense. But you know what he discovered later on? They don’t.[pause] Even after you ask hundreds of questions, the world makes no freaking sense at all. And it felt so… fruitless. I mean, this desire to understand, it comes from somewhere. Some fire inside you ignites it.[pause] But if everything amounts to nothing, there’s no point to keep it burning. So the man let the fire die out… and went on to live with the ashes." />
	<Line ID="60" Text="Oh, it’s not scary. He just wanted things around him to make sense. But you know what he discovered later on? They don’t.[pause] Even after you ask hundreds of questions, the world makes no freaking sense at all. And it felt so… fruitless. I mean, this desire to understand, it comes from somewhere. Some fire inside you ignites it.[pause] But if everything amounts to nothing, there’s no point to keep it burning. So the man let the fire die out… and went on to live with the ashes." />
	<Line ID="61" Text="But this man is leading the biggest corporation in the world. Surely he has all that a person can wish for." />
	<Line ID="62" Text="But these are good things!" />
	<Line ID="63" Text="I’m sure the fire was still reappearing from time to time." />
	<Line ID="64" Text="Is that your reason? Depression?" />
	<Line ID="65" Text="You’re right. He has more respect and money than almost anyone on the planet. Smiling people thank him. Kids with shiny eyes want to be like him. Brightest minds say what an honor it is to work for him.[pause] They say the world is getting better. They say it doesn’t have to end. And it only makes the matter worse." />
	<Line ID="66" Text="Compared to what, bad things? Those don’t happen to me. There are no bad things; therefore, there are no good things." />
	<Line ID="67" Text="Maybe, but he never really felt it. Instead, he was terrified. Terrified that it will go away again. Terrified that he no longer deserved it. Terrified to the point he’d rather go back to emptiness.[pause] He spent a few years meandering between the two flavors of misery… but in the end, the stable one won." />
	<Line ID="68" Text="Yes. You think it’s not good enough?" />
	<Line ID="69" Text="Nothing can be “good enough” to kill yourself. There is therapy, medications…" />
	<Line ID="70" Text="Good enough for what? To drag me here through time and space? No, I don’t think so." />
	<Line ID="71" Text="No, there is not. Not really. You see, while that man was sitting there, looking at the colorless reality, he finally realized something.[pause] It’s not just his problem. It’s not individuals who are getting more depressed; it’s the world. And you can’t put the whole world on medications." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="Then allow me to finish. You see, while that man was sitting there, looking at the colorless reality, he finally realized something.[pause] It’s not just his problem. It’s not individuals who are getting more depressed; it’s the world. And you can’t put the whole world on medications." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="…" />
	<Line ID="74" Text="We are so obsessed with our war against suffering; it’s virtually the only way forward society knows. If something is causing pain or discomfort, it needs to be eradicated.[pause] But what do you think happens when all cause for real sadness is removed? You end up with the unreal one… the more dangerous one. The one where you have nothing to blame but yourself.[pause] And the better our lives become, the harder it gets to reconcile them with our horrible feelings.[clear]There is a dark place deep inside of me… a black hole sucking everything in.  No scientific breakthrough in the universe can help me escape its singularity.[pause] Physicists got it all wrong, kid. They never noticed the most horrible and twisted natural phenomenon. Black holes eat our feeble attempts to be happy for breakfast and ask for more, never satisfied until we’re dead.[pause] And now when we can live forever, they won’t be satisfied at all.[clear]I chose to die like this because I want to stop the mockery. And you will help me. You have to." />
	
	<Line ID="90" Text="But what about problem solving? Why all the running around if you simply need me to pull the trigger?" />
	<Line ID="91" Text="What if I refuse to kill you?" />
	<Line ID="92" Text="So even a chance to live forever is a bad thing for you?" />
	<Line ID="93" Text="And what does time traveling have to do with this?" />
	<Line ID="94" Text="How did you even pull this off? I can’t imagine anybody else playing along with your crazy plan." />
	<Line ID="95" Text="If I agree and shoot you, what am I supposed to do next?" />
	<Line ID="96" Text="Why are you so old? Couldn’t you do the cells renewal?" />
	<Line ID="97" Text="What’s with the rotating countryside?" />
	<Line ID="98" Text="But… CEO of the biggest corporation in the world? There is no way my stupid little business could grow into something like this." />
	<Line ID="99" Text="This is ridiculous. I got dragged into the weirdest suicide attempt in history just because my future self is not feeling sufficiently happy." />
	<Line ID="100" Text="I’ve heard enough." />
	
	<Line ID="110" Text="Oh, that? That didn’t really matter. I just wanted to set up the mood." />
	<Line ID="111" Text="What do you mean, that didn’t matter?" />
	<Line ID="112" Text="I mean I simply asked Jackie to get you occupied with some stuff and make it emotionally challenging. The rest was up to her." />
	<Line ID="113" Text="So you don’t care what I’ve been doing all these days?" />
	<Line ID="114" Text="Not in the slightest. Do you think anybody else do, beside you and Jackie?" />
	<Line ID="115" Text="But I thought I was making a difference! That I was helping the world!" />
	<Line ID="116" Text="But I’ve been running around like a madman, dealing with one crazy thing after another! You can’t say none of this mattered." />
	<Line ID="117" Text="That’s very good. The more disillusioned you are, the better.[pause] You see, you started to do something. A bit of this, a bit of that, kind of unrelated, but maybe connected after all. You got engaged, attached, poured your soul into it.[pause] Now you want closure. You want the finale to explain how everything ties together, how it all makes sense in the end, forming a well-planned and insightful story, a well-spent and meaningful time.[clear]But real life doesn’t work this way. The universe knows better than that. In the end, it just goes on like nothing's happened, while you’re back at square one." />
	<Line ID="118" Text="Oh, but that’s my entire point.[pause] You see, you started to do something. A bit of this, a bit of that, kind of unrelated, but maybe connected after all. You got engaged, attached, poured your soul into it.[pause] Now you want closure. You want the finale to explain how everything ties together, how it all makes sense in the end, forming a well-planned and insightful story, a well-spent and meaningful time.[clear]But real life doesn’t work this way. The universe knows better than that. In the end, it just goes on like nothing's happened, while you’re back at square one." />
	<Line ID="119" Text="No, that’s not right. I did good things. I helped people. And I helped myself in the process." />
	<Line ID="120" Text="You’re wrong. My actions have affected the world. Everything we do affects the world, whether we want it or not." />
	<Line ID="121" Text="You sick bastard… you gambled with people’s lives and troubles just to prove a point." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="It doesn’t matter. What you say doesn’t matter; people just respond with the same thing. What you do doesn’t matter; the world just laughs. The best thing you can hope for is to laugh back." />
	<Line ID="123" Text="Couldn’t you just tell me this and save us all the trouble?" />
	<Line ID="124" Text="If nothing matters, why bother with your elaborate suicide plan?" />
	<Line ID="125" Text="You’re a nihilist. Tyler Durden wannabe." />
	<Line ID="126" Text="What about Jackie? Did you want to make her feel insignificant as well?" />
	<Line ID="127" Text="I think Jackie already proved you wrong. She took this opportunity and packed so much meaning and goodness into these days that you cannot imagine." />
	<Line ID="128" Text="Enough about this." />
	<Line ID="129" Text="No. To break an illusion of importance, there needs to be an illusion of importance first. But make no mistake, I created it for one and one purpose only: to shatter it before your eyes." />
	<Line ID="130" Text="I already told you. When the world laughs at you, the only thing left is to laugh back. I want my last laugh to be heard well. To reverberate through time." />
	<Line ID="131" Text="Call it what you want. If you put a label on a thing, that doesn’t make it any less right or wrong." />
	<Line ID="132" Text="Not really. But she’s my employee; it’s only natural that I keep her occupied." />
	<Line ID="133" Text="It is good that you are impressed by her. Stubborn idealism is a convenient power when dealing with the surrounding nonsense.[pause] But don’t mistake that power for a game-changer. In the end, she’s under the same illusions as you are. Thinking she makes the world better, oblivious to how inconsequential her efforts are.[pause] Humanity gets the world it deserves, according to its nature… and you can’t change the nature of humanity." />
	<Line ID="134" Text="As you wish." />
	
	<Line ID="140" Text="Then I will take the gun and shoot you instead. What happens after is anyone’s guess." />
	<Line ID="141" Text="You mean you don’t know? I thought your brilliant scientists have already figured out how time traveling works." />
	<Line ID="142" Text="I think you might not be able to do it. You know, grandfather paradox and stuff." />
	<Line ID="143" Text="That’s it? Either I shoot you or you shoot me?" />
	<Line ID="144" Text="Not this particular example. They are busy estimating other, less dramatic and more likely scenarios. I never asked them to calculate it for me… didn’t want to ruin the surprise." />
	<Line ID="145" Text="Oh, you can certainly think that way. Maybe the universe itself will step in and prevent me from killing you.[pause] Or maybe I’ll kill you and then disappear instantly, because I’ll stop existing in the first place. Or maybe I’ll kill you and nothing else will happen.[pause] In that case, I’ll have to finish off myself the old-fashioned way, which is a shame, and it will also mean wasting twice more bullets, but still… I’m willing to try and find out. The question is, are you?" />
	<Line ID="146" Text="That’s it. There is no other choice." />
	<Line ID="147" Text="And these two options are different how?" />
	<Line ID="148" Text="It’s hard to make a conscious decision when the only other option is to presumably die on the spot." />
	<Line ID="149" Text="I still think you’re overestimating the difference. Either way, it’s just two instances of one crazy man shooting each other in the face." />
	<Line ID="150" Text="What if I won’t let you take that gun? What if I take it first but don’t shoot?" />
	<Line ID="151" Text="I can just find somebody and tell them about your plan." />
	<Line ID="152" Text="What if I break the gun?" />
	<Line ID="153" Text="Enough about this." />
	<Line ID="154" Text="Enormously. I don’t want to just commit an elaborate suicide, I want you to understand and voluntarily pull that trigger; it should be your conscious decision.[pause] I am in no position to make a real statement, but you – you can prove this act of denial worthwhile." />
	<Line ID="155" Text="What can I say? The game was rigged from the start." />
	<Line ID="156" Text="You’re missing the point. Our actions are important, but the meaning we try to put into them is even more so.[pause] If there are forces in this world that can recognize this, they will hear. If not, then I’m just talking to myself, which would be a fitting end. At the very least, I’ll be consistent." />
	<Line ID="157" Text="Oh please, and then what? Make an exciting escape from the headquarters of an evil corporation? You’re no action hero.[pause] Also, good luck getting past our security system. We have the same fingerprints, and I specifically restricted my access to almost every floor." />
	<Line ID="158" Text="And who’s going to believe you? Most don’t even know we have a time-traveling project going on.[pause] They’ll just follow my instructions, and my instructions are to bring you back to this office, where we can try again and again if we need to." />
	<Line ID="159" Text="I have another one. But please, keep asking those questions; they’re entertaining." />
	<Line ID="160" Text="As you wish." />

	<Line ID="170" Text="The worst thing. Do you realize how much in our culture and existence relies on the fact that we’re all going to die?" />
	<Line ID="171" Text="Humanity seems to be enjoying it so far." />
	<Line ID="172" Text="Yeah, I noticed it already caused a lot of friction in society." />
	<Line ID="173" Text="That’s just the honeymoon period. Imagine what it’ll be like in 50 years, after the consequences sink in.[pause] Birthrates will drop dramatically: there is no point to be immortal through your genes when you can be immortal in the flesh. The spiral of progress will falter: there will be no such thing as “fresh talent,” only the same people doing the same jobs the same way they used to.[pause] Culture will fade away; stories told since prehistoric days will lose meaning, as the conflict with death is no more, and there is no story without a conflict.[clear]Fewer children to raise, fewer elders to care about, fewer things to empathize with. We will be a race of confused and miserable senile fools with young bodies, wondering what it’s like to die but never having the guts to do it." />

	<Line ID="177" Text="If this technology is so horrible, why does LIFE+ act as its main provider? Why didn’t you stop it from going public?" />
	<Line ID="178" Text="Maybe there’ll be other life-changing breakthroughs to address all that. Don’t you have any faith in progress?" />
	<Line ID="179" Text="You just poison everything with your negativity." />
	<Line ID="180" Text="Enough about this." />
	<Line ID="181" Text="It the realistic promise of immortality that matters. For thousands of years your eventual demise was as certain as a fact gets. Fate or chance, it was inevitable. That led to a complex system of beliefs and narratives, all based on that premise.[pause] But this thing has cracked the very foundation. Soon, any death will be seen as a failure; it will generate misery, not acceptance. There will be no closure to human life from now on." />
	<Line ID="182" Text="And what do you propose, exactly? People have already set their minds on immortality; voices of caution won’t help.[pause] No, the allure is too strong, too intoxicating. The path has been defined, and there is nothing we can do about it." />
	<Line ID="183" Text="Do you think one man could do it, even with my resources? Even before we were finished, similar researches started to emerge, some of them semi-legal and much more dangerous.[pause] Our only feasible option was to hire all those people and promise them we’d make it happen together. I thought confining it to LIFE+ would at least give me some control or influence later down the line.[pause] But that was back when I still cared about things… afterwards I just watched it happen." />
	<Line ID="184" Text="It won’t matter. You have to understand the extent of the problem. If plugging a chip into your brain and relieving ten amazing lives in one day becomes normal, the black hole will demand eleven.[pause] If twenty thrilling simulations are within reach, nineteen will look just… bland and boring. Any wonderful improvement will merely work up our appetite." />
	<Line ID="185" Text="Maybe. But I am not the origin of this poison. I can do nothing but spread the disease." />
	<Line ID="186" Text="As you wish." />
	
	<Line ID="190" Text="Time traveling is yet another way to mock humanity. It will trick us into thinking that life can be free from mistakes; that we can solve problems by simply reloading like in a video game.[pause] I want to make a statement on how ridiculous this belief is. I want to take this brand new toy the universe has given us and shove it back in its ugly laughing face." />
	<Line ID="191" Text="Simply reloading? And no butterfly effect? No paradoxes? Do you really think it’s possible?" />
	<Line ID="192" Text="And who’s gonna hear your “statement”?" />
	<Line ID="193" Text="Enough about this." />
	<Line ID="194" Text="I’m afraid it is. Ultimately, it’s just a matter of tackling complexity: running simulations, carefully calculating all probabilities.[pause] The sheer computational power in our possession can take this notoriously unpredictable thing and make it boringly, lifelessly safe." />
	<Line ID="195" Text="Somebody will. But it doesn’t really matter to me… those who stopped caring about themselves cannot care about others. I’m after the fact of the statement itself." />
	<Line ID="196" Text="As you wish." />

	<Line ID="200" Text="That’s because I didn’t tell them. The part about total secrecy was true; most have no idea about your little journey.[pause] As for those who do, well, I used the same lie. Changed a few documents, gave you a fake name. They think you’re a completely unrelated “lottery winner” from the past, and right now I’m giving you a pep talk about integration into our society." />
	<Line ID="201" Text="What about Jackie? Did she know the truth?" />
	<Line ID="202" Text="We never talked about this, but I’m sure she figured it out. I chose her to lead the project, so she was the only person who knew the details, and it’s rather easy to put the pieces together once you do." />
	<Line ID="203" Text="Why did you choose her?" />
	<Line ID="204" Text="I wonder why she never tried to stop you." />
	<Line ID="205" Text="Because I needed somebody who wouldn't try to stop me. Somebody who seeks reason in the actions of others, no matter how freaky they seem at first. I counted on her never-ending empathy, and it worked.[pause] Then again, it’s not like she could really stop me. Being the CEO of LIFE+ has its perks… and over the years I learned to cover my ass pretty well." />
	<Line ID="206" Text="Well, it’s not like she could – being the CEO of LIFE+ has its perks, and I also learned to cover my ass pretty well. Then again, I don’t think she wanted to.[pause] She’s the kind of person who seeks reason in the actions of others, no matter how freaky they seem at first. I counted on her never-ending empathy, and it worked. She has allowed me to indulge my final whim… and I hope you can do the same." />

	<Line ID="218" Text="You’re also… different. Like almost a completely unrelated person. Can a man really change so much?" />
	<Line ID="219" Text="Enough about this." />
	<Line ID="220" Text="Why shouldn’t I be old and decrepit? My broken body is a reflection of my broken mind.[pause] In “Doctor Zhivago,” the lead character dies from a heart attack while riding a tram, grey and tired; another character calls him “grandpa” before realizing he’s only 45. It was a story of a human life destroyed by social turmoil.[pause] My bane is a bit less apparent, but it can be just as deadly." />
	<Line ID="221" Text="For a limited time, maybe. But then the set point returns and everything becomes normal again." />
	<Line ID="222" Text="Of course, and then some. A person’s life can change drastically in a matter of weeks. What do you think decades can do?" />

	<Line ID="230" Text="Did it catch your attention? It’s just an old imperfect projector with some scenery porn loaded up, but it was pretty popular back when mid-air screens were becoming a thing.[pause] Some put it on top of the walls like interactive wallpapers, some used it all over museums and art exhibitions, some even placed it on windows – you know, in case you get bored with the same view every day." />
	<Line ID="231" Text="Sounds neat." />
	<Line ID="232" Text="Sounds stupid." />
	<Line ID="233" Text="Sounds like a useless gimmick." />
	<Line ID="234" Text="Here’s an interesting bit though: the company behind the idea eventually went bankrupt. Blew their advertising way out of proportions; called it “A Peaceful Corner,” the next big thing.[pause] Cited “studies” on how looking at something positive and beautiful boosts your productivity and improves your state of mind.[clear]So, people started to expect it would turn their stressful office routine into a sea of tranquility, and were naturally disappointed when it didn’t. Public perception is a funny thing.[pause] Still, I decided to dust one off today, for old times’ sake. A peaceful corner… that’s never really here." />
	<Line ID="235" Text="Well, it kinda did. Don’t take it as a sign of your leadership acumen or something, though. We just got lucky.[pause] And “lucky” is also a misleading term. It’s not like we won anything. Nobody wins." />
	<Line ID="236" Text="That’s part of the idea. The whole thing looks so pointless, so destructive on the outside, you can’t help but feel a certain allure towards it.[pause] Humanity’s hard work and determination gives us a brand new gift of moving through time, and what do I use it for? To erase myself from existence.[pause] Doesn’t it have “fuck you, universe” written all over? Hilarious!" />
	
	<Line ID="250" Text="Yes, that is good… I’m getting tired of talking. My head hurts a lot." />
	<Line ID="251" Text="My head hurts too, for what it’s worth." />
	<Line ID="252" Text="Then stop it. Abandon this crazy enterprise." />
	<Line ID="253" Text="Ah, you poor miserable sod." />
	<Line ID="254" Text="Well, we are the same person after all.[clear]Have you ever imagined… a day like this would come?" />
	<Line ID="255" Text="But that’s exactly what I’m doing. Do not worry; it will all be over soon enough.[clear]Have you ever imagined… a day like this would come?" />
	<Line ID="256" Text="Am I repulsing to you? I recommend getting used to it. After all, we are one and the same." />
	<Line ID="257" Text="I will never become you." />
	<Line ID="258" Text="Screw you. Just screw you." />
	<Line ID="259" Text="Yeah, right.[clear]Have you ever imagined… a day like this would come?" />
	<Line ID="260" Text="Yeah, can’t really blame you for that reaction.[clear]Have you ever imagined… a day like this would come?" />
	<Line ID="261" Text="You know, I probably have. I tend to wonder about all kinds of crazy stuff." />
	<Line ID="262" Text="Don’t do this to me. Don’t do this to us." />
	<Line ID="263" Text="No, my science fiction fantasies tend to be much more entertaining." />
	<Line ID="264" Text="The power of imagination, eh? Too bad I can’t feel these things anymore… I’m just a sad and tired old man. A lonely failure at the top of the world." />
	<Line ID="265" Text="Don’t tell what I should and shouldn’t do. I have free will, or at least a damn good illusion of it. That still counts for something." />
	<Line ID="266" Text="It’s nice to see you’re still using irony and sarcasm as a coping mechanism. Stick to it, my friend… it’s the only one you have." />
	<Line ID="267" Text="Is there anything I can do to make you reconsider?" />
	<Line ID="268" Text="This is absolutely ludicrous." />
	<Line ID="269" Text="No. Let’s finish this." />
	<Line ID="270" Text="It is. Now let’s finish this." />
	
	<Line ID="271" Text="(Take the gun)" />
	<Line ID="272" Text="No. And that is my final answer." />
	<Line ID="273" Text="I knew you’d come through. Want to say some classy final words before you kill this sorry bag of meat? You’ve earned it." />
	<Line ID="274" Text="I… don’t know what to say. This past week has been too much for me. I don’t know what’s right or wrong anymore." />
	<Line ID="275" Text="I think you’re mistaken, but I also respect your choice. If this is how my future self wishes to end his existence, I can give him as much." />
	<Line ID="276" Text="Just that this sad dystopia deserves it, and I’m happy to oblige." />
	<Line ID="277" Text="Don’t take it as a sign that you’ve convinced me. You disgust me. I’m just saving my own skin here, nothing more." />
	<Line ID="278" Text="No. Never been a big fan of classy final words, really." />
	<Line ID="279" Text="Then you understand. Thank you." />
	<Line ID="280" Text="Thank you. Truly." />
	<Line ID="281" Text="Amen to that." />
	<Line ID="282" Text="Works for me." />
	<Line ID="283" Text="Me neither." />
	<Line ID="284" Text="(Pull the trigger)" />
	<Line ID="285" Text="I see. You realize that I will most likely kill us both instead but still refuse. Care to provide some final explanation?" />
	<Line ID="286" Text="I just can’t. I understand your pain, but what you’re asking for… is murder and suicide combined. It is too much. I’m sorry. Do what you must." />
	<Line ID="287" Text="Because nobody should die here. Because it doesn’t have to be this way. Because even when all color is drained from your view, life is still worth living!" />
	<Line ID="288" Text="Two can play this game. I’m going to mock this miserable universe in my own way. I’m going to mock it by mocking you." />
	<Line ID="289" Text="Because, honestly, you disgust me. I don’t know how I turned into this sorry excuse of a person, but am not you yet. And I won’t play your grand game of self-pity, even if it gets me killed." />
	<Line ID="290" Text="No. I don’t think this situation deserves one." />
	<Line ID="291" Text="I’m… sorry too, for what it’s worth. I failed us. Nothing but misery lies ahead. It's better this way. Goodbye." />
	<Line ID="292" Text="Using any chance to persuade me until the very end, are you? I respect and understand that.[pause] But I’m sure you also understand by now that your future self is past the point of convincing. I planned this long ago, and I’m sticking to it. Goodbye." />
	<Line ID="293" Text="You would die just to spite me? We are the same man after all.[pause] I will now erase this man from existence. That should suffice. This world planned to mock him for eternity, but he can still have the last laugh. Ha. Ha. Ha." />
	<Line ID="294" Text="And here I was, hoping for some kind of understanding and agreement. But maybe you’re right…[pause] maybe it needs to end this way. I’ll just do what I have to." />
	<Line ID="295" Text="Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps we spent too much time talking and not enough time doing. Let’s rectify that, shall we?" />
