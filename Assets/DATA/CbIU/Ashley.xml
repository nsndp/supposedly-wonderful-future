  	<Line ID="0" Text="Are you the one in charge?" />
  	<Line ID="1" Text="Supposedly." />
  	<Line ID="2" Text="They keep telling me that." />
  	<Line ID="3" Text="As much as it surprises me, I am." />
  	<Line ID="4" Text="You must be someone really important from LIFE+." />
	<Line ID="5" Text="Not really. I’m just a time traveler." />
	<Line ID="6" Text="As the current situation stands… I guess you could say so." />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Wow. It’s out of my league to even imagine what your life must be like. But you probably want to hear what’s happened." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="If you can." />
	<Line ID="9" Text="Yes, let’s start from the beginning." />
	<Line ID="10" Text="Well, I should probably start with the show. Everything kinda revolved around it.[pause] I was doing a web series with a group of people; mostly as a lead actress, but also editing sometimes and giving other random help here and there. We would film it and upload online for people to watch.[pause] We’ve been going for about 2 years; you could say it was my main occupation." />
	<Line ID="11" Text="The beginning is probably the show. Everything kinda revolved around it.[pause] I was doing a web series with a group of people; mostly as a lead actress, but also editing sometimes and giving other random help here and there. We would film it and upload online for people to watch.[pause] We’ve been going for about 2 years; you could say it was my main occupation." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="What kind of web series?" />
	<Line ID="13" Text="Is it popular?" />
	<Line ID="14" Text="Go on." />
	<Line ID="15" Text="Comedy-drama, with some VR effects to make it more engaging." />
	<Line ID="16" Text="More or less. Nowhere near the top stars, but enough to have an active and supportive community." />
	<Line ID="17" Text="About ten days ago somebody apparently hacked into my account, because I was locked out, and then a blog post appeared under my name that I didn’t write, saying that I was leaving the show for good." />
	<Line ID="18" Text="Just suddenly leaving like that? Wasn’t it obvious that it’s not your post?" />
	<Line ID="19" Text="Oh, no, it was very convincing. Not a single inconsiderate word, but a lot of explanation: what a great ride it was, how much fun I had, but how I feel it’s time to move on.[pause] Future me could’ve written that, after doing this for 5 more years and finally getting tired. Not the present me, though. The present me still enjoyed every single second." />
	<Line ID="20" Text="Couldn’t you explain the situation to your fellow show makers? And, through them, to fans?" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="That’s exactly what I tried to do! I called them, they believed me, and then they tried to explain to people that the post was fake and I wasn’t going anywhere. Some were convinced, but others said I should make up my mind already.[pause] The internet security is so good these days; it’s hard to believe that stuff from your account can be not yours. Or maybe we just weren’t fast enough, and the message already sank in." />
	<Line ID="22" Text="Even so, shouldn’t the fans be grateful that you decided to stay?" />
	<Line ID="23" Text="That’s what I thought. But the negative comments I started to get after finally restoring my account… it was so unexpected and confusing.[pause] People said that I’d really better go, that I look tired and should leave the role to somebody who is more excited about it…" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="One moment they like you, the next moment they ask you to leave?" />
	<Line ID="25" Text="What kind of fans is that, forcing a lead actress to quit?" />
	<Line ID="26" Text="Well… that must’ve been a bummer." />
	<Line ID="27" Text="It’s like this story became the tipping point. The disappointment was building up in silence for some time, but then they decided to speak their mind.[pause] I mean, most said they still like the show… they just feel it will be better off without me." />
	<Line ID="28" Text="That’s an even meaner thing to say." />
	<Line ID="29" Text="That must’ve been tough." />
	<Line ID="30" Text="That’s… not a very nice situation to find yourself in." />
	<Line ID="31" Text="It’s better this way… I mean, the whole thing is kinda pointless unless viewers enjoy it, right?[pause] I just wish they could’ve said it sooner. I wish I didn’t fool myself into thinking that others like me.[pause] All this time, I felt that I really found my calling. I wanted to entertain people. Only people had different things in mind…" />
	<Line ID="32" Text="Hey, cheer up. This would not have happened if it wasn’t for a single person, and that person is going to answer for it." />
	<Line ID="33" Text="Yeah, people tend to do that." />
	<Line ID="34" Text="Thank you. I really appreciate all your help; it’s very important to me." />
	<Line ID="35" Text="It’s sad… we do so many wonderful things, but it takes so little to crush them." />
	
	<Line ID="45" Text="I was told you were fired. Is this what they meant?" />
	<Line ID="46" Text="And you were distressed so much you even considered suicide and blogged about it, right?" />
	<Line ID="47" Text="Can you tell me about the suspects?" />
	<Line ID="48" Text="I have more questions about the suspects." />
	<Line ID="49" Text="That should be all for now, thank you." />
	<Line ID="50" Text="Do you want to know something else?" />
	
	<Line ID="55" Text="No, I was fired from my “official” job as well. I worked part-time as a waitress at a small local cafe – well, a fancy small local cafe, you could probably say, as they employ real people to serve clients.[pause] I assume my boss wasn’t happy he no longer had a small-time actress for a waitress, because a couple of days into the incident he called and said I shouldn’t bother coming anymore." />
	<Line ID="56" Text="That’s a pretty strange reason to get rid of an employee." />
	<Line ID="57" Text="Wasn’t the show bringing you enough money?" />
	<Line ID="58" Text="I’ve got another question." />
	<Line ID="59" Text="A waitress job can get a bit weird, now that most food places rely on automated terminals or robots. If you serve people where a machine could do, smiling and being polite is not enough; you need to be special, to have a “twist.”[pause] I always knew my acting was the main reason he hired me. I just never thought it was the only twist I had." />
	<Line ID="60" Text="Sadly, no. We sell some merch here and there, but it’s not generating any significant income yet. I had to work on the side to pay the bills.[pause] To be honest, I’m also a bit wasteful when it comes to spending money… well, no other way but to get rid of that habit now, right?" />
	<Line ID="61" Text="Sure, I’ll try to answer." />
	
	<Line ID="65" Text="Y-yes, about that…[pause] Oh, God, I don’t know how to say it…[pause] You’re gonna arrest me too…" />
	<Line ID="66" Text="What’s the problem?" />
	<Line ID="67" Text="Let me guess… you didn’t really think about it, did you?" />
	<Line ID="68" Text="I didn’t…[pause] really consider it…[pause] I don’t think I have the guts to kill myself.[pause] I was just really depressed, and didn’t know what to do, and I’ve heard that the government and some corporations monitor and respond to blog posts like that, so…" />
	<Line ID="69" Text="No…[pause] I don’t think I have the guts to kill myself.[pause] I was just really depressed, and didn’t know what to do, and I’ve heard that the government and some corporations monitor and respond to blog posts like that, so…" />
	<Line ID="70" Text="Wait, you mean you deliberately tricked everyone? Made them think it’s more serious than it is?" />
	<Line ID="71" Text="…so you wrote it to attract attention." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="…so you thought it would be fun to use them for solving your own problems." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="Oh God, I’m so sorry…![pause] I just thought maybe someone would give me a call or something… I never thought it would be this serious![pause] You reacted like it’s a matter of national security. I couldn’t imagine that the most prominent corporation in the world would get involved…[pause] Oh, I’m in trouble, am I?" />
	<Line ID="74" Text="Yeah, well, I don’t think that’s entirely your fault…" />
	<Line ID="75" Text="Don’t worry about it. LIFE+ has its own agenda and its own reasons to be here." />
	<Line ID="76" Text="Who knows? I’m here just for the bullying part." />
	<Line ID="77" Text="I think you should be, but, either way, that comes after we find our culprit." />
	<Line ID="78" Text="I hope you’re right… Silly me, imposing on people with such stupid troubles…" />
	<Line ID="79" Text="I should be punished for this… Silly me, imposing on people with such stupid troubles…" />
	
	<Line ID="85" Text="Of course, I work with these people – used to work until recently, I mean… Who do you have in mind?" />
	<Line ID="86" Text="Sure, I’ll try to answer." />
	<Line ID="87" Text="Tell me about Karl." />
	<Line ID="88" Text="Tell me about Vivienne." />
	<Line ID="89" Text="Tell me about Daniel." />
	<Line ID="90" Text="Tell me about Anne." />
	<Line ID="91" Text="Tell me about Cloe." />
	<Line ID="92" Text="So you think none of them are guilty?" />
	<Line ID="93" Text="You and Daniel had another incident right before this happened, right?" />
	<Line ID="94" Text="Do you know why Cloe’s picture is a silhouette of a penguin?" />
	<Line ID="95" Text="Your Cloe refuses to talk to me." />
	<Line ID="96" Text="Let’s change the topic." />
	<Line ID="97" Text="Of course, just tell me how I can help." />
	
	<Line ID="100" Text="He’s a nice guy, even when he doesn’t sound like one. Very talented and committed, a perfectionist; I could never pay so much attention to little things.[pause] His acting is flawless, and the occasional episodes he writes always have a unique style. May not be the easiest person to work with, but the troubles are worth it." />
	<Line ID="101" Text="Do you think he did this?" />
	<Line ID="102" Text="Not a chance. He may talk bad about people, but to actually waste effort on bringing them down? Too busy leaving his mark on the world for that kind of thing." />
	<Line ID="103" Text="She’s amazing. A constant inspiration to me, really. The way she acts, moves and talks… it’s like she spends her every waking hour on a gigantic stage.[pause] She’s my co-lead; we have roughly equal parts on the show, and I always thought it’s unfair that I get more attention. Well, that’s not a problem anymore…" />
	<Line ID="104" Text="Do you think she did this?" />
	<Line ID="105" Text="Of course not. She is completely disinterested in mundane affairs; art is all she lives and breathes. I wish I could do that too… I wish I could disappear in art and forget about all this." />
	<Line ID="106" Text="He’s all right. Inconsiderate, sometimes, but that’s not because he doesn’t care about other people; he just doesn’t give it enough thought.[pause] He joined us only recently, and he’s not very committed, but I tried to teach him the basics, and he proved to be a decent learner. I’m sure he can become a great addition to the team." />
	<Line ID="107" Text="Do you think he did this?" />
	<Line ID="108" Text="Unlikely. He can be clueless, it might get unpleasant, but he’ll never hurt others knowingly.[pause] And that resignation post… well, it’s impossible to write something like that without realizing how much real damage it can bring." />
	<Line ID="109" Text="She’s my best friend. We’ve been together long before this show started. I kinda dragged her into it… chewed her ear off with talks about how awesome the whole thing was, he-he.[pause] Today, however, it’s impossible to imagine our decorations without her magical treatment, so it was totally worth it. I’m sure she never regrets it as well." />
	<Line ID="110" Text="Do you think she did this?" />
	<Line ID="111" Text="That’s just unthinkable. There is nothing in the world she cares about more than my mental and physical well-being.[pause] When I start to work too hard, she’s always there to look after me and squeeze some fun in. I’m honesty blessed to have such a wonderful friend." />
	<Line ID="112" Text="She’s awesome; we’d never had such kind and friendly atmosphere without her. She lives in her own world, but it’s a good kind of world; the kind of world we all should visit more.[pause] She’s our principal writer, and her stories and scripts are just as awesome as she is." />
	<Line ID="113" Text="Do you think she did this?" />
	<Line ID="114" Text="No way, she’s the sweetest person ever.[pause] And even if she wasn’t, she’s still too preoccupied with all those big topics and ideas flowing through her head. She’d probably find this whole business incredibly boring." />
	<Line ID="115" Text="Well, yes. I can’t wrap my head around a mere possibility of them doing something like this." />
	<Line ID="116" Text="Are you sure?" />
	<Line ID="117" Text="No disrespect or anything, but this incident may suggest you are prone to suddenly discovering stuff about people." />
	<Line ID="118" Text="Well… no. I’m not sure about anything anymore. In fact, you probably shouldn’t listen to me; I would only bring more confusion to the case." />
	<Line ID="119" Text="Yeah, you’re right. You probably shouldn’t give my opinion much credit. You’re in a better position to figure this out." />
	<Line ID="120" Text="Then who do you think it was?" />
	<Line ID="121" Text="I don’t have the slightest idea. I’m really sorry I can’t be of any real help. I feel so useless." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="More like a misunderstanding than an incident, really. I wouldn’t say we were closer than anybody else working on the show… but one day, he asked me out.[pause] I didn’t want to be in a relationship just yet, so I tried to say “no” in the politest way possible… but he wasn’t satisfied, and he kept trying.[pause] Then it got awkward. Then I might have said “no” in a less polite way… then this whole thing happened." />
	<Line ID="123" Text="But you still don’t think he did it." />
	<Line ID="124" Text="I don’t know… it could have been bad timing, right? It’s true that the conversation wasn’t smooth, but it’s also true that he tried to apologize the same evening.[pause] Besides, he never struck me as someone who can take his grudge this far. No, that would be too… out of character." />
	<Line ID="125" Text="Because she insists to be one." />
	<Line ID="126" Text="To be a penguin? Or to be a silhouette of a penguin?" />
	<Line ID="127" Text="How is that possible? You’ve met her in person, right? Doesn’t she look human?" />
	<Line ID="128" Text="Eh… right." />
	<Line ID="129" Text="I… don’t think she’s ever specified." />
	<Line ID="130" Text="Well, yeah. But you can never know for sure, right?" />
	<Line ID="131" Text="Do you want to know something else?" />
	<Line ID="132" Text="Impossible. Nobody enjoys thoughtful conversations more than Cloe." />
	<Line ID="133" Text="I mean, she speaks… but she only says nonsense." />
	<Line ID="134" Text="Yeah, “thoughtful” is not exactly how I would describe it…" />
	<Line ID="135" Text="Oh, that’s just how Cloe is. She doesn’t discern between nonsensical and ingenious." />
	
	<Line ID="150" Text="Hey, about that unexpected reaction from your fans…" />
	<Line ID="151" Text="Yes?" />
	<Line ID="152" Text="It wasn’t only hate, right?" />
	<Line ID="153" Text="No, some were really supportive. They told me not to listen to haters; said they’re not even real fans.[pause] But it was so few and far between… the negativity was overwhelming." />
	<Line ID="154" Text="Ashley, those folks were spot on. Your haters are not real fans. They’re not even real people!" />
	<Line ID="155" Text="What if I tell you that the entire backlash was actually coming from one place?" />
	<Line ID="156" Text="What do you mean?" />
	<Line ID="157" Text="They’re fake accounts. A hacker created them; the same person who wrote that resignation and posted it on your blog." />
	<Line ID="158" Text="I mean that one person impersonated many. Created dozens of fake accounts and made it look massive and predominant, when in fact it was not." />
	<Line ID="159" Text="But how’s that possible? You can’t just create another account, let alone so many; no more than you can make another identity card…" />
	<Line ID="160" Text="You can if you know how to break the security. Your attacker is a computer criminal, and a very capable one. But we managed to track the negative comments down to a single source. They’re definitely the work of one guy." />
	<Line ID="161" Text="And that guy wrote them because…" />
	<Line ID="162" Text="…because that was his plan from the start! He knew one post couldn’t change anything. Your own writing or not, these things are eventually accepted and forgotten. No, the trick was to make it seem as if people honestly want you to go. He never intended to fool the fans. He intended to fool you." />
	<Line ID="163" Text="…because that was his plan from the very beginning. He knew one post couldn’t change anything. Your own writing or not, these things are eventually accepted and forgotten. No, the trick was to make it seem as if people honestly want you to go. He never intended to fool the fans. He intended to fool you." />
	<Line ID="164" Text="Wow. I never even suspected…[pause] that…[pause] that changes quite a lot, isn’t it?" />
	<Line ID="165" Text="It does! Your viewers like you, Ashley, and no bully in the world can erase it." />
	<Line ID="166" Text="I hope it can lift your spirits, at the very least, because your spirit was the real target here." />
	<Line ID="167" Text="I… thank you. Does that mean you found the hacker as well?" />
	<Line ID="168" Text="Shawn is tracking him down as we speak. Shouldn’t take too long." />
	<Line ID="169" Text="No, but if Shawn can do his work, that will be rectified shortly." />
	<Line ID="170" Text="You really are a miracle worker. Thank you so much." />
	<Line ID="171" Text="Don’t thank me yet. It’s not over, but it will be soon." />
	<Line ID="172" Text="Just doing my part, since I got dragged into this anyway." />
	
	<Line ID="180" Text="Yes?" />
	<Line ID="181" Text="Well, Ashley, the case is closed. The criminal is successfully tracked down and arrested. I even talked to him." />
	<Line ID="182" Text="Just wanted you to know that our job is done. We found the hacker and gave him the full treatment. Quite a character he turned out to be…" />
	<Line ID="183" Text="Hold on for a moment." />
	<Line ID="184" Text="Is it someone I know?" />
	<Line ID="185" Text="No, just a stranger. A stranger who watched you from afar and planned his scheme." />
	<Line ID="186" Text="I don’t think so, but you can confirm it later with Shawn to be sure." />
	<Line ID="187" Text="Did he mention any reason for doing all this?" />
	<Line ID="188" Text="Not exactly, but it was written all over him. He’s a bitter man, envious of your work, your connection with fans and the joy it brings to everybody." />
	<Line ID="189" Text="No, I don’t think he needed one. He was driven by emotions… and not the good type of emotions either." />
	<Line ID="190" Text="His kind has only one reason: causing people pain and reveling in it. It’s the only way they know." />
	<Line ID="191" Text="That’s… that’s sad." />
	<Line ID="192" Text="Maybe, but it’s not you who should be sad anymore. You can go back to doing what you love the most. You can return to your calling." />
	<Line ID="193" Text="Don’t waste your empathy on this person; he spent enough time feeding on your emotions as it is. The important thing is that it’s over." />
	<Line ID="194" Text="Yeah, you’re right. It’s strange… I still feel kinda useless and inappropriate.[pause] I mean, you literally gave me back my life, and I don’t even know how to react." />
	<Line ID="195" Text="That’s normal, you need time to heal. But you won’t have to do it alone. Anne and the others are still your friends." />
	<Line ID="196" Text="That’s normal, you need time to heal. But you won’t have to do it alone. Anne and the others are still your friends. Shawn will be available too, in case you need more professional help." />
	<Line ID="197" Text="React however you want, really. My work is finished. The rest you’ll have to figure out by yourself." />
	<Line ID="198" Text="And Daniel? What happens to him?" />
	<Line ID="199" Text="He will be left to his own devices. You are free to pursue any kind of relationship… or lack thereof." />
	<Line ID="200" Text="What do you think I should do?" />
	<Line ID="201" Text="You should do what you wanted to do. Trust your feelings, Ashley." />
	<Line ID="202" Text="I think you should give him a chance. He honestly likes you… he’s just very bad at showing his feelings." />
	<Line ID="203" Text="He’s egotistical and stupid, but I think he means no harm. Take it as you like." />
	<Line ID="204" Text="Stay away from him. He’s an infantile loser, even if he wasn’t our culprit. You deserve better." />
	<Line ID="205" Text="Thank you. It’s so hard to sort your own feelings out, let alone the feelings of others…[pause] but we have to keep trying, right?" />
	<Line ID="206" Text="Thank you, I’ll do that. I promised myself to value the things I have.[pause] Funny, isn’t it? All these years of coexistence and cooperation, and we’re still so bad at understanding each other…" />
	<Line ID="207" Text="Thank you, I think I understand him a little better now. It’s so hard to understand people…[pause] but we have to keep trying, right?" />
	<Line ID="208" Text="Thank you for the warning. I guess that’s all we can do with bad people…[pause] ignore and stay away." />
	<Line ID="209" Text="And one more thing…" />
	<Line ID="210" Text="Yes?" />
	<Line ID="211" Text="Don’t let this incident derail your faith in humanity. Because here’s the thing, Ashley: I trust people too. I trusted your friends, and I trusted you that none of them would do this. And in the end, that led us to truth. So don’t you stop doing that. No matter how bad it can burn you sometimes, don’t stop believing in people." />
	<Line ID="212" Text="You should be more careful with others. Some just can’t be trusted. They may try to use you, or even hurt you. So keep your guard up. Maybe you won’t need it one day… but not today. The world is not there yet." />
	<Line ID="213" Text="No disrespect, but try to fix your gullible attitude a little. The world can be much more hostile and dangerous than you imagine. I’d hate to see it take advantage of a pure and earnest person like you." />
	<Line ID="214" Text="T-Thank you. You did so much for me… I’ll be sure to remember that." />
	<Line ID="215" Text="(Leave.)" />
	
	<Line ID="230" Text="Yes?" />
	<Line ID="231" Text="Well, Ashley, the case is closed. The culprit is apprehended." />
	<Line ID="232" Text="Just wanted you to know that our job here is done. The offender’s been arrested." />
	<Line ID="233" Text="Never mind." />
	<Line ID="234" Text="Was it really someone from the team?" />
	<Line ID="235" Text="Yes, it was Karl. His motive is solid." />
	<Line ID="236" Text="Yes, it was Vivienne. Her motive is solid." />
	<Line ID="237" Text="Yes, it was Daniel. His motive is solid." />
	<Line ID="238" Text="Yes, it was Anne. Her motive is solid." />
	<Line ID="239" Text="But… I don’t understand at all. Why would he do something like that?" />
	<Line ID="240" Text="He was jealous of your connection with fans. He’s the kind of person who talks high and mighty but feels small and insecure." />
	<Line ID="241" Text="He’s too arrogant to accept that you were the MVP in the team, not him. He couldn’t allow you to steal the spotlight." />
	<Line ID="242" Text="I… I can’t wrap my head around it. Why would she do something like that?" />
	<Line ID="243" Text="She has her own problems. There is a dangerous emptiness hidden beneath all those exuberant personalities." />
	<Line ID="244" Text="She couldn’t deal with you being the star of the show. The only reason she do what she does is her desperate need for attention." />
	<Line ID="245" Text="So it was him after all? I can’t believe it… why would he go so far?" />
	<Line ID="246" Text="I’m not sure he realized how far it was. He’s impulsive and ignorant, which is a dangerous mix." />
	<Line ID="247" Text="Because he’s a stupid egotistic boy, that’s why. A kind of person who hurts others without giving it any thought." />
	<Line ID="248" Text="That is insane. I can’t… I can’t even comprehend it. Why would she do something like that?" />
	<Line ID="249" Text="I don’t think she meant any harm. She was so fixated on protecting you from every little thing, it clouded her judgment. She started to treat you as a project, not as a friend." />
	<Line ID="250" Text="I’m afraid her feelings toward you turned into something toxic. She was uncomfortable when you found a whole bunch of other people to hang out with, so she tried to change it… maybe without realizing the consequences." />
	<Line ID="251" Text="People hide all kinds of dark feelings deep inside. Sometimes these feelings take control." />
	<Line ID="252" Text="That’s… that’s sad." />
	<Line ID="253" Text="Maybe, but it’s not you who should be sad anymore. You’ve had more than enough of that already." />
	<Line ID="254" Text="Don’t waste your empathy on this person. The important thing is that it’s over." />
	<Line ID="255" Text="But… what about the team? Will this be the end to our show?" />
	<Line ID="256" Text="Not necessarily. The others are still your friends, right? You can still make it work. And if you do, your bond will be stronger than ever before." />
	<Line ID="257" Text="Maybe, but it doesn’t mean you have to stop doing what you love. You can join another show, or start your own, or explore acting in different mediums. Opportunities are endless, as long as you don’t give up." />
