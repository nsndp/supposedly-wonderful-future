Ashley is sitting behind the same desk, while the desk nearby is occupied by another woman who looks slightly older.[pause] Daniel is not around, but there’s a different man, leaning against the wall to the left; he’s tall, blond and has a slightly bored expression on his face.[pause] There is an image of another man’s bearded face projected right onto the wall in front; he must be on a video call, participating in the meeting only remotely.)[clear](The wall to the right, however, contains the most peculiar sight of all: a girl is standing there, her arms crossed, her face a wide grin, a long and very realistic-looking sword beside her.[pause] To call her appearance flashy would be an understatement – it is in stark contrast with the regular daily clothing of others.[pause] She wears long brown pants, a strapless top, a red cape with an incredibly high neck and a pair of curiously-shaped sunglasses. The exposed part of her upper body is covered in tattoos, and her light blue hair is short and unruly.)[clear](Perhaps she mistook this meeting for an anime convention, but the others look completely unfazed by her sight.[pause] The captions conveniently allow you to identify all of the new faces: the blonde guy is “Karl, suspect A”; the woman next to Ashley is “Anne, suspect D”; the cosplayer is “Vivienne, suspect B”; and the man on the screen is “Boyd the Director.”)" />
