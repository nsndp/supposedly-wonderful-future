  	<Line ID="0" Text="Great Scott, Marty, you startled me!" />
  	<Line ID="1" Text="Okaaay…" />
  	<Line ID="2" Text="My name’s Michael, not Marty. I’m calling on behalf of LIFE+." />
  	<Line ID="3" Text="What the hell are you talking about?" />
  	<Line ID="4" Text="Well, don’t just stand there; time is of the essence. Do you require my assistance?" />
	<Line ID="5" Text="You are? Oh, well, I’m gonna call you Marty anyway. It would be preferable not to disrupt my concentration with unrelated data.[pause] Do you require my assistance?" />
	<Line ID="6" Text="Hmm… there must have been an unaccounted temporal displacement that resulted in this alternate reality where you don’t recognize me. Oh, well, I can work with that.[pause] Do you require my assistance?" />
	<Line ID="7" Text="Yes. I’m investigating the incident with Ashley, and I need you to answer my questions… if that is even possible with the way you speak." />
	<Line ID="8" Text="I do. I also require you to talk normally, without messing around." />
	<Line ID="9" Text="Of course it’s possible, Marty. If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything![pause] Worry not, I have received the information pertaining to the incident via digital messaging system, and I am ready to follow its explicit instructions. Fire away." />
	<Line ID="10" Text="I’m afraid I’m unable to do that, Marty. You can’t keep a good scientist down. Research must go on!" />
	<Line ID="11" Text="No, seriously. I need to talk to Vivienne, not whoever she is role-playing at the moment." />
	<Line ID="12" Text="Ugh… just answer the questions. You do know why I’m calling and what I need from you, right?" />
	<Line ID="13" Text="Marty, there is no reason these two things can’t happen at once; you’re just not thinking fourth-dimensionally.[pause] Worry not, I have received the information pertaining to the incident via digital messaging system, and I am ready to follow its explicit instructions. Ask your questions." />
	<Line ID="14" Text="Oh, yes, quite so. I have received the information pertaining to the incident via digital messaging system, and I am ready to
	follow its explicit instructions. Fire away." />
	
	<Line ID="15" Text="It’s good to see you, Marty!" />
	<Line ID="16" Text="Marty, you’ve made it!" />
	<Line ID="17" Text="Do you know why you are under suspicion?" />
	<Line ID="18" Text="Tell me about your relationship with Ashley." />
	<Line ID="19" Text="What is your role in the team?" />
	<Line ID="20" Text="What do you think about the incident?" />
	<Line ID="21" Text="What do you think about Daniel?" />
	<Line ID="22" Text="I think you’re guilty, and I can tell you why." />
	<Line ID="23" Text="Hey, Doc…" />
	<Line ID="24" Text="I’ll be back." />
	
	<Line ID="30" Text="It appears that I unintentionally gained access to a sensitive and normally restricted piece of information, which gave me theoretical means to compromise Ashley’s emotional well-being and become the catalyst for the transpired events." />
	<Line ID="31" Text="That’s… one way to describe it, yes." />
	<Line ID="32" Text="Try to be more concise, will you?" />
	<Line ID="33" Text="English, Doc." />
	<Line ID="34" Text="I believe the digital messaging system referred to it as “knowing her password.”[pause] Please excuse the crudity of my language; I’m still trying to fully grasp the technology of this time. It’s quite different from my permanent place of residence in the Old West." />
	<Line ID="35" Text="Well, did you? Become the catalyst?" />
	<Line ID="36" Text="But I assume you’re gonna tell me you didn’t do it." />
	<Line ID="37" Text="Of course not, Marty, why would I do such a thing? Ashley was, and I hope still is, the key player of the project I chose to participate in. I had no intention to compromise its success." />
	
	<Line ID="40" Text="As you know, Marty, my involvement in any social relationship here in 2048 could result in a disruption of the space-time continuum; as a scientist, I try not to take that risk.[pause] Having said that, she’s a wonderful friend, and I enjoy working with her immensely." />
	<Line ID="41" Text="Do you have any kind of professional rivalry?" />
	<Line ID="42" Text="Still, she was such a fans’ favorite up until recently. It must be annoying when your co-lead takes all the attention away." />
	<Line ID="43" Text="Were these feelings strong enough to want her out of the picture?" />
	<Line ID="44" Text="I have another question." />
	<Line ID="45" Text="No, that would only distract from successfully achieving our common goals. I have no interest in any kind of imaginary competitions." />
	<Line ID="46" Text="Well… I suppose I do experience such emotions from time to time, if I’m being completely honest.[pause] I spend days and nights perfecting my performance, yet her sole natural charm attracts an army of admirers so big, they could probably produce 1.21 gigawatts all by themselves! My calculations just don’t seem to be correct this time." />
	<Line ID="47" Text="Go on." />
	<Line ID="48" Text="I’m not going to hide it, Marty, this is a demanding endeavor. It was essential to my plan that I travel to 2048 alone, but it has also made things more taxing.[pause] I miss my dear Clara, and our rhythmic ceremonial rituals under the stars. I miss my boys. I miss the good social standing I established as the blacksmith of Hill Valley back in 1880s." />
	<Line ID="49" Text="No, Marty, I would never choose such an irresponsible course of action. We may stumble, we may experience illogical emotions, but in the end, a scientist should welcome challenges. It’s all part of the package.[pause] The pitfalls and the possibilities, the perils and the promise… perhaps there’s even an answer lurking around the corner. An answer to that universal question “Why?”" />
	<Line ID="50" Text="I like your inquisitive nature, Marty." />
	
	<Line ID="55" Text="I act, Marty! Portray actions and emotions of a fictional human being while others film it on camera.[pause] And the episodic play I participate in becomes instantaneously available to everyone on Earth the moment it’s been completed! Can you imagine that?" />
	<Line ID="56" Text="What about the others?" />
	<Line ID="57" Text="Never thought you’d be interested in acting, Doc." />
	<Line ID="58" Text="Fine, another question." />
	<Line ID="59" Text="Capable performers who contribute to the project’s success, all of them. I especially like Anne’s work – she always builds her models to scale and paints them." />
	<Line ID="60" Text="You know me, Marty – I’m interested in anything that helps us gain a clearer perception of humanity. Ronald Reagan was once an actor too, right?" />
	<Line ID="61" Text="Can do, Marty." />
	
	<Line ID="70" Text="An unfortunate happenstance… but I’m sure Ashley will turn out fine." />
	<Line ID="71" Text="That’s it? Aren’t you worried about her? She took it pretty hard." />
	<Line ID="72" Text="At least somebody agrees that she’s overreacting." />
	<Line ID="73" Text="Yeah, right. Just like Jennifer and I turned out fine." />
	<Line ID="74" Text="No-no-no-no, I didn’t mean it that way. What’s happened is an awful, awful, awful, awful mess.[pause] I simply have faith she’ll manage to get through it, emerging stronger and more experienced than ever before. We all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives, but those decisions cannot be imposed." />
	<Line ID="75" Text="No-no-no-no, I didn’t mean it that way. What’s happened is an awful, awful, awful, awful mess, and she has every right to feel bad about it.[pause] I simply have faith she’ll manage to get through it, emerging stronger and more experienced than ever before. We all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives, but those decisions cannot be imposed." />
	<Line ID="76" Text="Precisely. I didn’t tell you about the car accident, but I brought you to the future, and in the end you saw enough to figure it out by yourself.[pause] We all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives, Marty, but those decisions cannot be imposed. I’m certain she will get through it, and emerge stronger and more experienced than ever before." />
	<Line ID="77" Text="That’s a pretty positive way to look at things." />
	<Line ID="78" Text="But this entire problem was imposed on her. She needs help, not a lecture on personal growth!" />
	<Line ID="79" Text="Sounds like you’re just trying to downplay the whole thing. Personal interests, maybe?" />
	<Line ID="80" Text="Don’t get me wrong, Marty, I fully approve of your efforts to uncover the truth; the search for knowledge is the most commendable activity in the universe.[pause] But the unpleasant fact is that the damage is already done. Ashley is at the temporal junction point, and she will need to make a good future for herself.[pause] Unless you want to travel back in time and prevent the incident from happening… which, I suppose, can be arranged." />
	<Line ID="81" Text="Marty, are you implying that I was the cause of the incident? I would never do such a thing![pause] I merely say that we are forced to accept an unpleasant fact: the damage is already done. Ashley is at the temporal junction point, and she will need to make a good future for herself.[pause] Unless you want to travel back in time and prevent the incident from happening… which, I suppose, can be arranged." />
	<Line ID="82" Text="Marty, are you implying that I was the cause of the incident again? I already told you, I would never do such a thing![pause] I merely say that we are forced to accept an unpleasant fact: the damage is already done. Ashley is at the temporal junction point, and she will need to make a good future for herself.[pause] Unless you want to travel back in time and prevent the incident from happening… which, I suppose, can be arranged." />
	<Line ID="83" Text="She doesn’t want to make anything new. She wants her old life back." />
	<Line ID="84" Text="Please stop dancing around the question." />
	<Line ID="85" Text="Can’t remember you being so ready to “make a good future” when you nearly lost your dear Clara. Something about “one in a googolplex”?" />
	<Line ID="86" Text="Nobody said she has to leave our project, Marty. I, for one, would be thrilled if she chooses to continue on her current path, despite the derision of bystanders.[pause] True scientists never abandon their commitments!" />
	<Line ID="87" Text="Can this kind of activity really be considered dancing? I must admit, I’m a little behind in my exploration of the recent additions to cultural traditions.[pause] Shame, too; I’m sure my wife would love see a couple of new moves." />
	<Line ID="88" Text="You got me there, Marty. But nobody said she has to leave our project – on the contrary, I’m sure everyone will be thrilled if she chooses to continue on her current path despite the derision of bystanders.[pause] True scientists never abandon their commitments!" />
	
	<Line ID="90" Text="He’s a nice enough kid. Rarely assists in my experiments, but we tend to share conversations either way.[pause] He once revealed to me that he’s amorously infatuated with Ashley, and sought advice on successful mating. I recommended Florence Nightingale effect." />
	<Line ID="91" Text="Do you think he wrote that fake resignation post?" />
	<Line ID="92" Text="You what?!" />
	<Line ID="93" Text="“Successful mating”? That does sound like him. And like you. That sounds like both of you." />
	<Line ID="94" Text="Unlikely. I’m not sure he understood what I meant, or that he generally understands enough to engage in such activity.[pause] The boy might have a few short circuits in his bionic implants. That seems to happen in this 2048, despite the absence of bionic implants." />
	<Line ID="95" Text="Don’t worry, Marty, I don’t think he understood what I meant.[pause] The boy might have a few short circuits in his bionic implants. That seems to happen in this 2048, despite the absence of bionic implants." />
	<Line ID="96" Text="I’m not sure he understood what I meant, though.[pause] The boy might have a few short circuits in his bionic implants. That seems to happen in this 2048, despite the absence of bionic implants." />
	
	<Line ID="100" Text="Marty, what are you talking about?" />
	<Line ID="101" Text="Please, Vivienne. Why must you always play a role? Do you feel unsatisfied with who you are? Are you that much uncomfortable inside your own skin?" />
	<Line ID="102" Text="Oh, drop your act just for one second, will you? Talk to me like yourself. Is there even such a thing as “yourself”?" />
	<Line ID="103" Text="On second thought, let’s not jump ahead of the train yet." />
	<Line ID="104" Text="My thoughts precisely." />
	<Line ID="105" Text="It’s an exercise in acting, Marty! By incorporating other personalities into my daily routine, I produce enough energy to…" />
	<Line ID="106" Text="Yes, but there is a reason nobody does that all the time. It can expand your experience, but it should never replace it. You may want others to view it as a funny quirk, but I see it as a sign of deeper problems." />
	<Line ID="107" Text="Spare me your long passages. You’re just an insecure escapist, hiding behind imaginary characters. People who are happy to be themselves must freak you out." />
	<Line ID="108" Text="Marty, what in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton has gotten into you? Have you been racing with Needles again?" />
	<Line ID="109" Text="Problems like this can manifest themselves in weird ways. You probably couldn’t deal working alongside Ashley. She was doing the same thing you do so differently, yet she was so happy. Something had to be changed." />
	<Line ID="110" Text="I think, deep inside, you’re starving for attention. So when Ashley started to take it away with her winning personality, you tried to remove her. A fitting behavior for someone who has no personality of their own." />
	<Line ID="111" Text="No-no-no-no-no, Marty. If you must insist on ridiculing my lifelong passion and questioning my quest for knowledge, then this is where we part ways.[pause] Feel free to exercise your authority, but I can entertain your narrow mind no longer. I’ve had enough practical jokes for one day. Goodbye, corporate boy!" />
	<Line ID="112" Text="(Leave.)" />
	
	<Line ID="115" Text="What is it, Marty?" />
	<Line ID="116" Text="You didn’t sell the flux capacitor technology to a company named LIFE+, did you?" />
	<Line ID="117" Text="So, how are things with the family?" />
	<Line ID="118" Text="Do you like this 2048?" />
	<Line ID="119" Text="You know the irony of this? I’m a real time traveler, but I pretend that I’m not so I can talk with somebody pretending to be a time traveler." />
	<Line ID="120" Text="Doc Brown… you know what else is brown? Poop. He-he." />
	<Line ID="121" Text="Let’s change the topic." />
	<Line ID="122" Text="You’re the doc, Marty. No, wait, I’m the doc." />
	<Line ID="123" Text="Sell? Impossible! I didn’t invent the time machine for financial gain. Need I remind you how dangerous it can be in the wrong hands?" />
	<Line ID="124" Text="No, I think we both know that too well at this point." />
	<Line ID="125" Text="I’m afraid my worst reminders are yet to come, Doc." />
	<Line ID="126" Text="Precisely." />
	<Line ID="127" Text="Sounds heavy, Marty. But I’m sure you’ll figure it all out." />
	<Line ID="128" Text="All is well, Marty. Clara and I enjoy a peaceful marriage, and our boys are growing up as insatiably curious as I was at their age.[pause] I’m away quite frequently, but they never get lonely, because I can return right when I left. The way I see it, if you’re going to take a lot of business trips, why not do it in time?" />
	<Line ID="129" Text="It’s satisfactory enough, I suppose. True, we haven’t achieved all of our dreams, but at least it’s not as dusty as in 1885. Also, less hanging.[pause] I’m still trying to figure out this whole “online world” thing, though." />
	<Line ID="130" Text="Oh, it’s pretty interesting. Fits nicely with your whole “we don’t need roads” thing. " />
	<Line ID="131" Text="Please don’t waste your intellect on that place." />
	<Line ID="132" Text="You and everybody else, Doc." />
	<Line ID="133" Text="It does? Perhaps I should factor in some additional research." />
	<Line ID="134" Text="I’m afraid I’m unable not to, Marty! I am compelled to explore." />
	<Line ID="135" Text="Another great mystery of the universe, then? Challenge accepted!" />
	<Line ID="136" Text="Great Scott, Marty, the overlapping layers of this particular temporal scheme are starting to challenge my thinking capacities.[pause] I might need to hit my head on the sink one more time to understand it." />
	<Line ID="137" Text="Please, Marty, you’re starting to sound like Biff. And even he hates poop." />
	<Line ID="138" Text="Sorry, sorry. All these years of being your lab assistant, I just couldn’t resist." />
	<Line ID="139" Text="Well, gotta go. Doody calls." />
	<Line ID="140" Text="As you know, this is an anglicized surname; my ancestors were known as the Von Brauns before they settled in our family mansion in Hill Valley.[pause] Too bad it caught an accidental fire in 1962, so I had to continue working from my garage." />
	<Line ID="141" Text="Didn’t you deliberately burn it down for insurance money?" />
	<Line ID="142" Text="Anyway, gotta go. Doody calls." />
	<Line ID="143" Text="You think so? Well, I guess the history will never know." />
	<Line ID="144" Text="Oh, kids these days…" />
	
	<Line ID="150" Text="Marty, can you update me on the status of the modern space exploration program? It appears that the progress has been considerably slower than projected, and I’m not quite sure why.[pause] Almost 80 years after landing on the Moon, and we didn’t even colonize it yet!" />
	<Line ID="151" Text="Beats me. I’m just as bummed about it as the next time-traveling guy." />
	<Line ID="152" Text="Colonizing the Moon is heavy, Doc." />
	<Line ID="153" Text="Can I be excluded from your role-playing shenanigans?" />
	<Line ID="154" Text="Yes, it seems that everyone who has experienced a temporal displacement concurs in their assessment of the situation. Perhaps the fact that we skip big stretches of time, like I skipped through everything since 1985, contributes to our forming of unrealistic expectations.[pause] Or maybe we should just join our intellectual efforts. Do you think NASA would be interested in working with me?" />
	<Line ID="155" Text="On the contrary, colonizing the Moon should be only 0.166 as heavy as colonizing the Earth." />
	<Line ID="156" Text="Well, then, there must be some other complications." />
	<Line ID="157" Text="Being “heavy” has nothing to do with gravitational pulls, Doc… I thought we already covered that." />
	<Line ID="158" Text="That is my conclusion as well. I imagine the fact that I skipped through everything since 1985 has contributed to my forming of unrealistic expectations.[pause] Or maybe I should just allow them to borrow my intellectual facilities. Do you think NASA would be interested in working with me?" />
	<Line ID="159" Text="Right, right, sorry. I imagine the fact that I skipped through everything since 1985 has contributed to my forming of unrealistic expectations.[pause] Or maybe I should just allow them to borrow my intellectual facilities. Do you think NASA would be interested in working with me?" />
	<Line ID="160" Text="I think NASA would be thrilled, Doc." />
	<Line ID="161" Text="No idea, but I can ask my new friend later, if you want. She’s not NASA, but she pretty much runs the show now." />
	<Line ID="162" Text="Splendid! I’ll have to go back to that stupid 2015 again and stop a couple of local wars, but after that I’m completely available.[pause] Anyway, do you have another inquiry?" />
	<Line ID="163" Text="Did your head recently come in contact with one of Biff’s limbs, Marty? You seem strangely disinterested in the wonders of the universe.[pause] Anyway, do you have another inquiry?" />
	
	<Line ID="164" Text="Say, Marty, would you recommend visiting a local rejuvenation clinic? As you remember, I already added a good 30 or 40 years to my life back in that other, more successful version of 2015, and I was planning to do the same here, but my colleague warned that it’s been “getting negative reviews.”[pause] I’m not quite sure what that means; is it dangerous?" />
	<Line ID="165" Text="Nah, it’s nothing you should worry about. Go for it, Doc; you deserve to be quasi-immortal." />
	<Line ID="166" Text="Very dangerous. You should stay away from anything that’s getting negative reviews, Doc." />
	<Line ID="167" Text="I don’t care. I want no part in your stupid make-believes." />
	<Line ID="168" Text="Splendid! It is nice to see that some technology from our first future visit still makes its way into this reality. Makes me less anxious about the fact that I’m constantly messing with it, riding around on my time train.[pause] Anyway, do you have another inquiry?" />
	<Line ID="169" Text="Is that so? Thank you for the fair warning, Marty. I suppose it’s inevitable that our quest for progress would produce some dark, destructive things along the way.[pause] Anyway, do you have another inquiry?" />
	<Line ID="170" Text="Hmm, it seems that these “negative reviews” possess the power to affect reality simply by being mentioned, like making someone unusually grumpy. A dangerous thing indeed.[pause] Anyway, do you have another inquiry?" />
	
	<Line ID="171" Text="Marty, you’re back! Thanks for sending your friend to my place; it’s always nice to have a little break and reminisce about our old adventures with fellow enthusiasts.[pause] Do you have another inquiry?" />
